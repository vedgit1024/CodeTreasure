The representation should be based on a preorder traversal of the binary tree and must adhere to the following guidelines: Node Representation: Each node in the tree should be represented by its integer value. Parentheses for Children: If a node has at least one child (either left or right), its children should be represented inside parentheses. Specifically: Omitting Empty Parentheses: Any empty parentheses pairs (i.e., ()) should be omitted from the final string representation of the tree, with one specific exception: when a node has a right child but no left child. In such cases, you must include an empty pair of parentheses to indicate the absence of the left child. This ensures that the one-to-one mapping between the string representation and the original binary tree structure is maintained. In summary, empty parentheses pairs should be omitted when a node has only a left child or no children. However, when a node has a right child but no left child, an empty pair of parentheses must precede the representation of the right child to reflect the tree's structure accurately."

Note that a function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively. A function's exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program.

The Skiplist works this way: Artyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons You can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, add, erase and search can be faster than O(n). It can be proven that the average time complexity for each operation is O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(n).

You can enter a vertex at any time, but can leave a vertex only when the signal is green. You cannot wait at a vertex if the signal is green. The second minimum value is defined as the smallest value strictly larger than the minimum value.
