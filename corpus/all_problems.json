    "description": " Aryan loves graph theory more than anything. Well, no, he likes to flex his research paper on line graphs to everyone more. To start a conversation with you, he decides to give you a problem on line graphs. In the mathematical discipline of graph theory, the line graph of a simple undirected graph GG is another simple undirected graph L(G)L(G) that represents the adjacency between every two edges in GG.Precisely speaking, for an undirected graph GG without self-loops or multiple edges, its line graph L(G)L(G) is a graph such that  Each vertex of L(G)L(G) represents an edge of GG.  Two vertices of L(G)L(G) are adjacent if and only if their corresponding edges share a common endpoint in GG.   Also, L0(G)=GL^0(G)=G and Lk(G)=L(Lk−1(G))L^k(G)=L(L^{k-1}(G)) for k≥1k\\geq 1. An Euler trail is a sequence of edges that visits every edge of the graph exactly once. This trail can be either a path (starting and ending at different vertices) or a cycle (starting and ending at the same vertex). Vertices may be revisited during the trail, but each edge must be used exactly once.Aryan gives you a simple connected graph GG with nn vertices and mm edges and an integer kk, and it is guaranteed that GG has an Euler trail and it is not a path graph∗^{\\text{∗}}. He asks you to determine if Lk(G)L^k(G) has an Euler trail. ∗^{\\text{∗}}A path graph is a tree where every vertex is connected to atmost two other vertices."

The sets of vertices of GG that the vertices of G′G' map to are pairwise disjoint and combined cover all the vertices of GG, i.e., the sets of vertices of GG mapped by vertices of G′G' form a partition of the vertex set of GG.

Consider it takes 1 sec for each car to pass the toll, i.e., the first car in a lane has angriness 11, the second car has angriness 22, and so on.To reduce congestion and frustration, cars are allowed to switch lanes. A car can instantly move to the back of any other lane at any time. However, changing lanes increases its angriness by an additional kk units due to the confusion caused by the lane change.Harshith, being the awesome person he is, wants to help the drivers by minimising the total angriness of all cars.

Aryan is allowed to change lanes of any car anytime (possibly zero), but his goal is to find the minimum possible total angriness if the lane changes are done optimally.

That is, every element in a segment must also be present in the segment following it.For example, if a=[1,2,2,3,1,5]a = [1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 5], a cool partition Yousef can make is b1=[1,2]b_1 = [1, 2], b2=[2,3,1,5]b_2 = [2, 3, 1, 5]. This is a cool partition because every element in b1b_1 (which are 11 and 22) also appears in b2b_2. In contrast, b1=[1,2,2]b_1 = [1, 2, 2], b2=[3,1,5]b_2 = [3, 1, 5] is not a cool partition, since 22 appears in b1b_1 but not in b2b_2.Note that after partitioning the array, you do not change the order of the segments. Also, note that if an element appears several times in some segment bjb_j, it only needs to appear at least once in bj+1b_{j + 1}.Your task is to help Yousef by finding the maximum number of segments that make a cool partition."

As he spent several hours walking around it, gathering his strength, he noticed something curious: the spruce is actually a tree∗^{\\text{∗}} — and not just any tree, but one consisting of an odd number of vertices nn. Moreover, on n−1n-1 of the vertices hang Christmas ornaments, painted in exactly n−12\\frac{n-1}{2} distinct colors, with exactly two ornaments painted in each color. The remaining vertex, as tradition dictates, holds the tree's topper.At last, after several days of mental preparation, Polycarp began dismantling the spruce. First, he removed the topper and had already started taking apart some branches when suddenly a natural question struck him: how can he remove one of the tree's edges and rearrange the ornaments in such a way that the sum of the lengths of the simple paths between ornaments of the same color is as large as possible?In this problem, removing an edge from the tree is defined as follows: choose a pair of adjacent vertices aa and bb (a<ba < b), then remove vertex bb from the tree and reattach all of bb's adjacent vertices (except for aa) directly to aa.Polycarp cannot continue dismantling his spruce until he gets an answer to this question. However, checking all possible options would take him several more years. Knowing your experience in competitive programming, he turned to you for help.

Nothing foreshadowed trouble until the plane entered a zone of strange flickering fog. Radio communication was interrupted, the instruments spun wildly, and flashes of unearthly light flickered outside the windows.For simplicity, we will assume that the Bermuda Triangle and the airplane are on a plane, and the vertices of the triangle have coordinates $$$(0, 0)$$$, $$$(0, n)$$$, and $$$(n, 0)$$$. Initially, the airplane is located at the point $$$(x, y)$$$ strictly inside the Bermuda Triangle and is moving with a velocity vector $$$(v_x, v_y)$$$. All instruments have failed, so the crew cannot control the airplane.The airplane can escape from the triangle if it ever reaches exactly one of the vertices of the triangle. However, if at any moment (possibly non-integer) the airplane hits the boundary of the triangle (but not at a vertex), its velocity vector is immediately reflected relative to that side$$$^\\dagger$$$, and the airplane continues to move in the new direction.Determine whether the airplane can ever escape from the Bermuda Triangle (i.e., reach exactly one of its vertices). If this is possible, also calculate how many times before that moment the airplane will hit the boundary of the triangle (each touch of the boundary, even at the same point, counts; crossing a vertex does not count).$$$^\\dagger$$$ Reflection occurs according to the usual laws of physics.

If his current power is xx, then with one paddle stroke the kayak moves xx meters in the current direction. Gleb can turn around and continue moving in the opposite direction, but such a maneuver is quite challenging, and after each turn, his power decreases by 11. The power can never become 00 — if his current power is 11, then even after turning it remains 11. Moreover, Gleb cannot make two turns in a row — after each turn, he must move at least once before making another turn. Similarly, Gleb cannot make a turn immediately after the start — he must first perform a paddle stroke.Gleb wants to reach point ss from point 00 without leaving the segment [0,s][0, s] and while preserving as much power as possible. Help him — given the value ss and his initial power kk, determine the maximum possible power he can have upon reaching point ss."

    "description": "The visitors of the IT Campus \"NEIMARK\" are not only strong programmers but also physically robust individuals! Some practice swimming, some rowing, and some rock climbing!Master Igor is a prominent figure in the local rock climbing community. One day, he went on a mountain hike to ascend one of the peaks. As an experienced climber, Igor decided not to follow the established trails but to use his skills to climb strictly vertically.Igor found a rectangular vertical section of the mountain and mentally divided it into nn horizontal levels. He then split each level into mm segments using vertical partitions. Upon inspecting these segments, Igor discovered convenient protrusions that can be grasped (hereafter referred to as holds). Thus, the selected part of the mountain can be represented as an n×mn \\times m rectangle, with some cells containing holds.Being an experienced programmer, Igor decided to count the number of valid routes. A route is defined as a sequence of distinct holds. A route is considered valid if the following conditions are satisfied:   The first hold in the route is located on the very bottom level (row nn);  The last hold in the route is located on the very top level (row 11);  Each subsequent hold is not lower than the previous one;  At least one hold is used on each level (i.e., in every row of the rectangle);  At most two holds are used on each level (since Igor has only two hands);  Igor can reach from the current hold to the next one if the distance between the centers of the corresponding sections does not exceed Igor's arm span. Igor's arm span is dd, which means he can move from one hold to another if the Euclidean distance between the centers of the corresponding segments does not exceed dd. The distance between sections (i1,j1i_1, j_1) and (i2,j2i_2, j_2) is given by √(i1−i2)2+(j1−j2)2\\sqrt{(i_1 - i_2) ^ 2 + (j_1 - j_2) ^ 2}.Calculate the number of different valid routes. Two routes are considered different if they differ in the list of holds used or in the order in which these holds are visited."

Misha thought that since the product of LCM and GCD exists, it might be interesting to consider their quotient: F(a,b)=lcm(a,b)gcd(a,b)F(a,b)=\\frac{lcm(a, b)}{gcd(a, b)}.For example, he took a=2a = 2 and b=4b = 4, computed F(2,4)=42=2F(2, 4) = \\frac{4}{2} = 2 and obtained a prime number (a number is prime if it has exactly two divisors)! Now he considers F(a,b)F(a, b) to be an interesting ratio if a<ba < b and F(a,b)F(a, b) is a prime number.Since Misha has just started studying number theory, he needs your help to calculate — how many different pairs of numbers aa and bb are there such that F(a,b)F(a, b) is an interesting ratio and 1≤a<b≤n1 \\leq a < b \\leq n?"

Now, the organizing committee must choose the locations for the desks in the venue.Each desk occupies one of the mm spots in a row. Moreover, if several desks occupy consecutive spots in the same row, we call such a group of desks a bench, and the number of desks in the group is the bench's length. For example, seating 77 participants on a 3×43 \\times 4 venue (with n=3,m=4n = 3, m = 4) can be arranged as follows:  In the figure above, the first row has one bench of length 33, the second row has one bench of length 22, and the third row has two benches of length 11.The organizing committee wants to choose the locations so that the length of the longest bench is as small as possible.

In other words, you do not know if it is true that all handles starting with uppercase letters come first, followed by those starting with lowercase letters — or vice versa, that all handles starting with lowercase letters come first, followed by those starting with uppercase letters.Lexicographical order is the order of standard string comparison, formally defined as follows:  if strings ss and tt differ in some positions, the earliest of which is position ii, then string ss comes before string tt in lexicographical order if and only if si<tis_i < t_i (for example, for the strings cats and current, the first position with different characters is 22, and the character a is less than the character u, so cats is lexicographically less than current);  if strings ss and tt have no positions with different characters, then the shorter one comes first. For example, the string cat comes before the string cats. Due to restricted access to the database, you can make no more than 1010 queries to it. Determine the position of the handle you are interested in, knowing that it is definitely in the list."

However, you do not know which barrel contains the poison. Your task is to identify this poisonous barrel.All the barrels are on scales. Unfortunately, the scales do not show the exact weight of each barrel. Instead, for each pair of barrels, they show the result of a comparison between the weights of those barrels. Thus, for any two barrels, you can determine whether their weights are equal, and if not, which barrel is heavier. The poison and water are included in the weight of the barrel.The scales are always turned on, and the information from them can be used an unlimited number of times.You also have the ability to pour water. You can pour water from any barrel into any other barrel in any amounts.However, to pour water, you must physically handle the barrel from which you are pouring, so if that happens to be the poisonous barrel, you will die.

Out of 55 balanced bracket sequences with 33 good pairs, there exists only one such sequence \"((()))\" with the good pair (2,5)(2,5). Therefore, one can see that Emily does not always need nn turns to guess ss.To find out the content of ss as early as possible, Emily wants to know the number of different balanced bracket sequences that match the clues after each turn. Surely, this is not an easy job for Emily, especially when she is given so many good pairs. Now it is your turn to help Emily. Given the clues, you must find the answer before and after each turn.

A block is s[l,r]s[l,r] satisfying:   l=1l=1 or sl≠sl−1s_l\\not=s_{l-1}.  sl=sl+1=…=srs_l=s_{l+1} = \\ldots = s_{r}.  r=nr=n or sr≠sr+1s_r\\not=s_{r+1}. Adjacent blocks are two blocks s[l1,r1]s[l_1,r_1] and s[l2,r2]s[l_2,r_2] satisfying r1+1=l2r_1+1=l_2.For example, if s=0001100111s=\\mathtt{000}\\,\\mathbf{11}\\,\\mathbf{00}\\,\\mathtt{111}, Kevin can choose the two blocks s[4,5]s[4,5] and s[6,7]s[6,7] and swap them, transforming ss into 0000011111\\mathtt{000}\\,\\mathbf{00}\\,\\mathbf{11}\\,\\mathtt{111}.Given a string tt of length nn consisting of '0', '1' and '?', Kevin wants to determine the minimum number of operations required to perform such that for any index ii (1≤i≤n1\\le i\\le n), if ti≠t_i\\not= '?' then si=tis_i=t_i.

In \"T-generation\", there is exactly one student with each independence levels from ll to rr, inclusive. For a team of three pupils with independence levels aa, bb, and cc, the value of their team independence is equal to (a⊕b)+(b⊕c)+(a⊕c)(a \\oplus b) + (b \\oplus c) + (a \\oplus c), where ⊕\\oplus denotes the bitwise XOR operation.

The specific type of the puzzle they are solving is described below. They are given an equality with addition and subtraction which may or may not be a correct one. They have to verify the equality, and if it is not a correct one, then they have to tell if it is possible to turn it into a correct one by moving one digit to a different place in the equality.Let us formally define the equality in this puzzle:   Number is a string of at least one and at most 10 decimal digits ('0' to '9') that has no extra leading zeroes (the only number that is allowed to start with the zero digit is \"0\").  Expression is a string composed of one or more numbers, as defined above, that are separated with addition ('+') or subtraction ('-') operators.  Equality is a string composed of an expression, as defined above, followed by an equals sign ('='), followed by another expression.  Correct equality is an equality where both expressions on the left and right hand sides of the equals sign evaluate to the same decimal number according to the standard arithmetic. Note that while all the numbers in the expression are positive, the evaluated number can be negative. Also, the evaluated number can be longer than 10 digits.  Moving a digit in an equality means removing a digit from any position in the string and inserting it into another position so that the resulting string is again an equality. The puzzle is pretty straightforward once you know how to add and subtract decimal numbers, but it is tenuous. It is easy to get distracted and make a mistake while performing computation. Your task is to write a program that solves the expression correction puzzle to help Eve."

In this version, if any spider has more than 11 plushie at any point in time, they will throw all but 11 away.The process is stable in the current year if each spider has the same number of plushies (before the current year's exchange) as he did the previous year (before the previous year's exchange).

The challenging terrain separates the different states in the country, resulting in an extremely inconvenient inter-state commute and more crucially a lack of central governmental control. Adding on top of that is a rampant crime rate that increases annually, and this severely disrupts the everyday lives of innocent citizens.A recent protest finally shed light on the situation, as the newly elected president has announced an ambitious project to resolve these issues. Her plan consists of two major components. The first is the construction of high-speed railways between the states to facilitate better connections and unity across the country. Since the states are mostly running independently from each other, to construct a railway between states uu and vv, the government has to pay a fee of au+ava_u + a_v dollars, with aua_u dollars given to state uu and ava_v dollars given to state vv. The railway operates bidirectionally, meaning that once it is built, people from state uu can now travel to state vv and vice versa. A railway can be built between almost any pair of states, except for mm particular pairs for which the terrain dividing them is so treacherous that the construction of a direct railroad between the two states becomes impossible.The second component of the project is to build a centralized prison that manages all criminals across the country. Given the large number of estimated prisoners, the president decided to pick one of the states to build the central prison and sever the connection from the state to the rest of the country.   An illustration for the sample input 1. (a) The costs of building direct railways between the states. (b) Consider building the central prison in State #3. All direct railroads that do not involve State #3 have to be built, with a total cost of 3+3+2=83+3+2=8 dollars. Given the above, the president would like to search for the minimum cost plan to construct railroads between the states so that:  the state with the central prison should not have any railway connecting it to any other states, and  all the other states should be connected, i.e., people should be able to travel from one such state to another, possibly by taking more than one train. You are working for the team in charge of the overall planning of the construction. The meeting with the president is happening in just a few hours, at which time you will have to brief her on the cost of different construction plans. Please calculate, for each state uu, the minimum cost plan to construct railroads between states meeting the above conditions when uu is where the central prison is built."

Instead, you want to use Alice's sorting function as a building block for your own solution. There are two ways as listed below you can utilize her function, but each of them can be applied at most once. The order in which these two operations are invoked can be arbitrary.  Prefix sort: choose a length i∈{1,2,…,n}i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\} and call alicesort(s,i)\\texttt{alicesort(}s, i\\texttt{)}. This sorts the first ii elements in the array ss.  Suffix sort: choose a length i∈{1,2,…,n}i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\} and call alicesort(s+n−i,i)\\texttt{alicesort(}s+n-i, i\\texttt{)}. This sorts the last ii elements in the array ss. Due to the time complexity of the sorting algorithm, the cost of performing either a prefix or suffix sort is i2i^2, where ii is the length of the chosen subarray. Your goal is to determine the minimum cost to sort the input array ss of nn integers in non-decreasing order using Alice's function, following the rules mentioned above.For example, Let s=[3,2,5,5,4,1]s=[3,2,5,5,4,1]. We can first perform a suffix sort of length 44, and the array becomes [3,2,1,4,5,5][3,2,1,4,5,5]. Then, we perform a prefix sort of length 33, and the array becomes [1,2,3,4,5,5][1,2,3,4,5,5], which is a sorted array. The cost is 42+32=254^2+3^2=25. Here is another example, let s=[4,3,2,1]s=[4,3,2,1]. We can complete the sorting by performing only a prefix sort of length 44, and the cost is 42=164^2=16."

Here, a polygon is point symmetric if there exists a center cc such that for every point pp in the polygon, the reflection p′p^\\prime of pp across cc is also in the polygon.While designing an arbitrary point symmetric convex polygon shape is easy, the cost of rebuilding is very high.

See the following figure for an example:  In the example above, A-Ju's castle is a shape of the convex polygon formed by points (3,7)−(2,1)−(6,3)(3, 7) - (2, 1) - (6, 3).

The difference can be calculated as the sum of the additional area (represented by the green grid region) and the shaved area (represented by the red line region).Please write a program that helps A-Ju design a blueprint of the new castle, such that the area of the symmetric difference between the original one and the new one is minimized.

In an interdisciplinary collaboration, an ecosystem scientist and a computer scientist join forces to analyze the structure of a complex ecosystem using computational methods. The ecosystem scientist models the ecosystem as a directed graph D=(V,A)D = (V, A), where each species is represented by a node v∈Vv \\in V, and each feeding relationship is represented as a directed edge (x,y)∈A(x, y) \\in A from prey xx to predator yy. This graph structure allows them to simulate the flow of energy throughout the ecosystem from one species to another.Two essential features of the ecosystem are defined:  Independent Trophic Group: A set SS of animal species is classified as an independent trophic group if no species x∈Sx \\in S can reach another species y∈Sy \\in S (for some y≠xy \\ne x) through a series of directed feeding relationships, meaning there is no directed path in DD from xx to yy.  Trophic Balance Species: A species is termed a trophic balance species if it has a nearly equal number of species that affect it as directly or indirectly predators (species it can reach via a directed path in DD, excluding itself) and species that affect it as directly or indirectly prey (species that can reach it via a directed path in DD, excluding itself). Specifically, trophic balance species are those for which the absolute difference between the above two numbers is minimum among all species in the ecosystem. Consider an ecosystem with n=4n = 4 species and m=3m = 3 feeding relationships:   Species 1: Grass (Node 1)   Species 2: Rabbits (Node 2)   Species 3: Foxes (Node 3)   Species 4: Hawks (Node 4) The directed edges representing the feeding relationships are as follows:   (1,2)(1, 2): Grass is eaten by Rabbits.   (2,3)(2, 3): Rabbits are eaten by Foxes.   (2,4)(2, 4): Rabbits are also eaten by Hawks. Now, consider the set S={3,4}S=\\{3,4\\} (Foxes and Hawks). There are no directed paths between Foxes (Node 3) and Hawks (Node 4); Foxes cannot reach Hawks, and Hawks cannot reach Foxes through any directed paths. Therefore, this set qualifies as an independent trophic group.Examination of Species Species 1 (Grass):      Can reach: 3 (Rabbits, Foxes, and Hawks)    Can be reached by: 0 (None)    Absolute difference: |3−0|=3|3 - 0| = 3     Species 2 (Rabbits):     Can reach: 2 (Foxes and Hawks)    Can be reached by: 1 (Grass)    Absolute difference: |2−1|=1|2 - 1| = 1   Species 3 (Foxes):     Can reach: 0 (None)    Can be reached by: 2 (Grass and Rabbits)    Absolute difference: |0−2|=2|0-2| = 2   Species 4 (Hawks):     Can reach: 0 (None)    Can be reached by: 2 (Grass and Rabbits)    Absolute difference: |0−2|=2|0-2| = 2   Among these species, Rabbits have the smallest absolute difference of 11, indicating that they are a trophic balance species within the ecosystem. It is known that any independent trophic group in the ecosystem has a size of at most kk. The task is to find the set of all trophic balance species in the ecosystem."

The owner of the bar has another nn bottles with distinct heights b1,…,bnb_1, \\ldots, b_n that he would like Mayaw to put on the first row. To ensure that all bottles on the rack are visible, the owner requires that each bottle on the back row should not be blocked by the one put in front of it. That is, if a bottle of height hh is put on the ii-th spot (from left) in the first row, then hh must be less than aia_i. However, not all such arrangements are good for the owner. To pay tributes to the Maxi Mountain nearby, he additionally demands that the bottles in the front row should display a mountain-like shape. In particular, the heights of the bottles, when listing from left to right, should form a sequence that is first (non-strictly) increasing and then (non-strictly) decreasing.Unfortunately, sometimes it is impossible to achieve owner's requirements. That is why Mayaw is also allowed to slightly reduce a bottle's height by removing its cap that has a height of 11. In other words, after the removal of the cap, the height of the bottle decreases by exactly 11. Of course, exposing the Epah inside the bottle to the open air is detrimental to its quality, and therefore it is desirable to remove as few bottle caps as possible.Can you help Mayaw determine the minimum number of caps needed to be removed so that he can arrange the bottles in a way that satisfies the owner's requirements? Note that the positions of the bottles in the back row are fixed and Mayaw is not allowed to modify them."

    "description": "  You are designing a snazzy new text editor, and you want to add a nifty auto-complete feature to help users save time. Here is how it will work: if a user types \"App\", your editor will magically suggest the word \"Application\"! Even better, users can personalize the words that auto-complete in your editor.Your editor will support 4 kinds of operations (Let's say the current text in your editor is tt):   Add an auto complete pattern pip_i.  Delete an auto complete pattern pip_i.  Append a string ss to the end of tt.  Delete cc characters from the end of tt. Note that if cc is larger then the length of tt, delete all the characters from tt. After each action, your editor should suggest an auto-complete candidate ii that matches the following criteria:   The string pip_i has a prefix equal to tt.  If there are multiple pip_i, pick the longest one.  If there are still multiple pip_i, pick the one with the smallest lexicographic order.  If there are still multiple pip_i, pick the one with the smallest ID.  To simplify the question, for each action, print the suggested auto complete pattern ID. If there's no match, print -1.For example, let us say we have three candidates: \"alice\", \"bob\", and \"charlie\", with ID 1, 2, and 3. At first, there is nothing on the screen, so \"charlie\" (3) should be suggested because it is the longest. Then, let us say the user types \"b\". You should suggest \"bob\" (2) because it is the only one that starts with \"b\". Finally, let us say the user type \"body\". You should print -1 because there is no matched pattern."

However, occasionally, some songs make Alice feel bored. After some research, Alice believes that this is because even though the songs she chose are all different, due to her instinctive preference, they all turn out to be musically similar to one another.To thoroughly analyze this, Alice decided to study the sheet music of the songs. For convenience, Alice represented a song of length nn as an integer sequence a1,a2,…,ana_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n, where aia_i is the pitch of the ii-th note. Then she defined the musical equivalence between songs. Two songs a1,a2,…,ana_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n and b1,b2,…,bnb_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n of length nn are musically equivalent if for all 1≤i<n1\\leq i<n, both ai,ai+1a_i, a_{i+1} and bi,bi+1b_{i}, b_{i+1} have the same pitch relationship. More specifically, ai,ai+1a_i, a_{i+1} and bi,bi+1b_i, b_{i+1} have the same pitch relationship if either   ai<ai+1a_i < a_{i + 1} and bi<bi+1b_i < b_{i + 1},  ai=ai+1a_i = a_{i + 1} and bi=bi+1b_i = b_{i + 1}, or  ai>ai+1a_i > a_{i + 1} and bi>bi+1b_i > b_{i + 1}.  For example, 1,2,3,3,21, 2, 3, 3, 2 and 5,9,13,13,15, 9, 13, 13, 1 are musically equivalent, while 1,2,3,2,11, 2, 3, 2, 1 and 1,2,2,2,11, 2, 2, 2, 1 are not. Having practiced consistently for a long time, Alice is able to sing any note in the range of [1,k][1, k].

Well—the concept of a \"line\" here is not what we usually think of. Claire refers each line to be a set of consecutive vertical grid cells. When she draws a line, these cells are all covered with black ink. Initially, all the cells are white, and drawing lines turns some of them black. After drawing a few lines, Claire wonders: how many ways she can color an additional white cell black so that the remaining white cells do not form a single connected component.Two cells are directly connected if they share an edge. Two cells xx and yy are indirectly connected if there exists a sequence of cells c0,c1,…,ckc_0, c_1, \\ldots, c_k with k>1k > 1 such that c0=xc_0 = x, ck=yc_k = y, and for every i∈{1,2,…,k}i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, k\\} the cells cic_i and ci−1c_{i-1} are directly connected.

Naturally, there are a lot of bowling alleys all over the country, and the competition between them is as intense as you can imagine.Maw-Shang owns one such bowling alley. To stand out from other competitors in the industry and draw attention from customers, he decided to hold a special event every month that features various unorthodox bowling rules. For the event this month, he came up with a new version of the game called X-pin bowling. In the traditional 1010-pin bowling game, a frame is built out of ten bowling pins forming a triangular shape of side length four. The pin closest to the player forms the first row, and the two pins behind it form the second row, and so on. Unlike the standard version, the game of XX-pin bowling Maw-Shang designed allows a much larger number of pins that form a larger frame. The following figure shows a standard 1010-pin frame on the left, and on the right it shows a 2121-pin frame that forms a triangular shape of side length six which is allowed in the game of XX-pin bowling.  Being the national sport, the government of Taiwan strictly regulates and standardizes the manufacturing of bowling pins. There are two types of bowling pins allowed, one in black and the other in white, and the bowling alley Maw-Shang owns has ww white pins and bb black pins. To make this new game exciting for the customers, Maw-Shang wants to build the largest possible frame from these w+bw+b pins. However, even though he is okay with using both colors in building the frame, for aesthetic reasons, Maw-Shang still wants the colors of the pins on the same row to be identical. For example, the following figure shows two possible frames of side length six, but only the left one is acceptable to Maw-Shang since the other one has white and black pins mixed in the third row.  The monthly special event is happening in just a few hours. Please help Maw-Shang calculate the side length of the largest frame that he can build from his w+bw+b pins!"

In other words, for each ii from 11 to n−1n - 1, barrels ii and i+1i + 1 are connected by a single horizontal pipe at height hih_i. The widths of the pipes are negligible. These pipes allow water to flow between barrels.  Now you want to play with barrels. Your plan is to maximize the volume of the water in the first barrel by throwing clay into barrels. In one step, you can choose any barrel and throw one unit of clay into it. One unit of clay has the same volume as one unit of water. Clay is heavier than water and doesn't mix with it, so it falls to the bottom of the barrel, distributing evenly.Clay has a sticky structure, so it seals pipes if the clay column is high enough. More formally, suppose the pipe is at height hh. If the height of the clay column is also \\boldsymbol{h}\\boldsymbol{h} (or lower), the pipe is working. But the moment you add more clay into the barrel, the pipe becomes sealed instantly, preventing any water from moving between barrels.You have a mountain of clay, so you can repeat the step described above any number of times. However, between the steps, you have to wait until the water reaches the new equilibrium.What is the maximum water volume you can collect in the first barrel?Assume that the barrels are high enough, so the water doesn't overflow, and the pipe widths are negligible."

With Timar, he can select any segment of length kk and instantly strengthen all of it (changing every character in that segment to 11).

Attempting to contain their excitement, Penchick crafted a rooted tree to keep Chloe and himself busy.Penchick has a rooted tree∗^{\\text{∗}} consisting of nn vertices, numbered from 11 to nn, with vertex 11 as the root, and Chloe can select a non-negative integer dd to create a perfect binary tree†^{\\text{†}} of depth dd.Since Penchick and Chloe are good friends, Chloe wants her tree to be isomorphic‡^{\\text{‡}} to Penchick's tree. To meet this condition, Chloe can perform the following operation on her own tree any number of times:  Select an edge (u,v)(u,v), where uu is the parent of vv.  Remove vertex vv and all the edges connected to vv, then connect all of vv's previous children directly to uu. In particular, doing an operation on an edge (u,v)(u, v) where vv is a leaf will delete vertex vv without adding any new edges.Since constructing a perfect binary tree can be time-consuming, Chloe wants to choose the minimum dd such that a perfect binary tree of depth dd can be made isomorphic to Penchick's tree using the above operation. Note that she can't change the roots of the trees.∗^{\\text{∗}}A tree is a connected graph without cycles.  A rooted tree is a tree where one vertex is special and called the root.  The parent of vertex vv is the first vertex on the simple path from vv to the root. The root has no parent.  A child of vertex vv is any vertex uu for which vv is the parent.  A leaf is any vertex without children. †^{\\text{†}}A full binary tree is rooted tree, in which each node has 00 or 22 children.  A perfect binary tree is a full binary tree in which every leaf is at the same distance from the root. The depth of such a tree is the distance from the root to a leaf.‡^{\\text{‡}}Two rooted trees, rooted at r1r_1 and r2r_2 respectively, are considered isomorphic if there exists a permutation pp of the vertices such that an edge (u,v)(u, v) exists in the first tree if and only if the edge (pu,pv)(p_u, p_v) exists in the second tree, and pr1=r2p_{r_1} = r_2."

To ensure that Penchick would love this gift, Kohane has a few goals:  No filling is used exactly once; that is, each filling must either not appear at all or appear at least twice.  For any two buns ii and jj that have the same filling, the distance between them, which is |i−j||i-j|, must be a perfect square∗^{\\text{∗}}.

There are also nn buttons on the machine, each button corresponds to a slot, with exactly one button corresponding to each slot. Unfortunately, the labels on the buttons have worn off, so you do not know which button corresponds to which slot.When you press the button corresponding to the ii-th slot, one of two events occurs: If there is a can of lemonade in the ii-th slot, it will drop out and you will take it. At this point, the number of cans in the ii-th slot decreases by 11. If there are no cans of lemonade left in the ii-th slot, nothing will drop out. After pressing, the can drops out so quickly that it is impossible to track from which slot it fell. The contents of the slots are hidden from your view, so you cannot see how many cans are left in each slot. The only thing you know is the initial number of cans in the slots: a1,a2,…,ana_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n.Determine the minimum number of button presses needed to guarantee that you receive at least kk cans of lemonade.Note that you can adapt your strategy during the button presses based on whether you received a can or not. It is guaranteed that there are at least kk cans of lemonade in total in the machine. In other words, k≤a1+a2+…+ank \\leq a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n."

The road is divided into nn sections, numbered from 11 to nn from left to right. The height of the surface in the ii-th section is equal to aia_i. If the height of the ii-th section is greater than 00, then the dump truck must take sand from the ii-th section of the road, and if the height of the ii-th section is less than 00, the dump truck must fill the pit in the ii-th section of the road with sand. It is guaranteed that the initial heights are not equal to 00.When the dump truck is in the ii-th section of the road, it can either take away xx units of sand, in which case the height of the surface in the ii-th section will decrease by xx, or it can fill in xx units of sand (provided that it currently has at least xx units of sand in its bed), in which case the height of the surface in the ii-th section of the road will increase by xx.The dump truck can start its journey from any section of the road. Moving to an adjacent section on the left or right takes 11 minute, and the time for loading and unloading sand can be neglected. The dump truck has an infinite capacity and is initially empty.You need to find the minimum time required for the dump truck to level the sand so that the height in each section becomes equal to 00. Note that after all movements, the dump truck may still have sand left in its bed. You need to solve this problem independently for the segments numbered from lil_i to rir_i.

Each node of this tree is a magical source, connected to other such sources through magical channels (edges). In total, there are n−1n-1 channels in the tree, with the ii-th channel connecting nodes viv_i and uiu_i. Moreover, there exists a unique simple path through the channels between any two nodes in the tree.However, the magical energy flowing through these channels must be balanced; otherwise, the power of the Tree of Life may disrupt the natural order and cause catastrophic consequences. The sages of the kingdom discovered that when two magical channels converge at a single node, a dangerous \"magical resonance vibration\" occurs between them. To protect the Tree of Life and maintain its balance, it is necessary to select several paths and perform special rituals along them. A path is a sequence of distinct nodes v1,v2,…,vkv_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_k, where each pair of adjacent nodes viv_i and vi+1v_{i+1} is connected by a channel. When the sages perform a ritual along such a path, the resonance vibration between the channels (vi,vi+1)(v_i, v_{i+1}) and (vi+1,vi+2)(v_{i+1}, v_{i+2}) is blocked for each 1≤i≤k−21 \\leq i \\leq k - 2.The sages' task is to select the minimum number of paths and perform rituals along them to block all resonance vibrations. This means that for every pair of channels emanating from a single node, there must exist at least one selected path that contains both of these channels.Help the sages find the minimum number of such paths so that the magical balance of the Tree of Life is preserved, and its power continues to nourish the entire world!"

Each game is characterized by two parameters: pip_i (1≤pi≤1001 \\le p_i \\le 100) and wiw_i — the probability of winning the game in percentage and the winnings for a win.  If you lose in any game you decide to play, you will receive nothing at all (even for the games you won).

    "description": "This is the easy version of the problem. In the two versions, the constraints on qq and the time limit are different. In this version, q=0q=0. You can make hacks only if all the versions of the problem are solved.A team consisting of nn members, numbered from 11 to nn, is set to present a slide show at a large meeting. The slide show contains mm slides.There is an array aa of length nn. Initially, the members are standing in a line in the order of a1,a2,…,ana_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n from front to back. The slide show will be presented in order from slide 11 to slide mm. Each section will be presented by the member at the front of the line. After each slide is presented, you can move the member at the front of the line to any position in the lineup (without changing the order of the rest of the members). For example, suppose the line of members is [3,1,2,4][\\color{red}{3},1,2,4]. After member 33 presents the current slide, you can change the line of members into either [3,1,2,4][\\color{red}{3},1,2,4], [1,3,2,4][1,\\color{red}{3},2,4], [1,2,3,4][1,2,\\color{red}{3},4] or [1,2,4,3][1,2,4,\\color{red}{3}].There is also an array bb of length mm. The slide show is considered good if it is possible to make member bib_i present slide ii for all ii from 11 to mm under these constraints.However, your annoying boss wants to make qq updates to the array bb. In the ii-th update, he will choose a slide sis_i and a member tit_i and set bsi:=tib_{s_i} := t_i. Note that these updates are persistent, that is changes made to the array bb will apply when processing future updates.For each of the q+1q+1 states of array bb, the initial state and after each of the qq updates, determine if the slideshow is good."

A patient can be in both the queue and the stack. Each patient is characterized by the time their visit to the doctor will take (the time is the same for both doctors).When the appointments begin, the doctors will see patients in the order of the queue and stack, respectively. As soon as a doctor finishes with one patient, he will call the next one.But there is one problem: if a patient is in both the queue and the stack, and he is called to one doctor first and then to the other, while he has not yet finished with the first one, confusion will arise. It is allowed for a patient to go to the second doctor at the exact moment he finishes with the first doctor.The current configuration of the queue and stack is called good if the doctors can see all the patients without any confusion arising.Initially, both the queue and the stack are empty. There are three types of queries:   add patient xx to the queue;  add patient xx to the stack;  patient xx, who was in the queue, realizes he is in the wrong place and moves to the stack; however, he moves to the position in the stack as if he had entered the stack at the moment of the query when he entered the queue. It is guaranteed that after each query, each patient is no more than once in the queue and no more than once in the stack.After each query, you need to determine if the current configuration is good."

If the other cow is also on island ii, then after this cow moves to another island, the island collapses, and the other cow is eliminated from the race.  After an island or bridge collapses, no cows may use them.  If a cow is eliminated, their turn is skipped for the rest of the race. The race ends once either cow reaches island nn.

Specifically:   when multiplying the string nn by the integer aa, he will get the string s=n+n+⋯+n+n⏟a timess=\\underbrace{n + n + \\dots + n + n}_{a\\ \\text{times}}  when subtracting the integer bb from the string ss, the last bb characters will be removed from it. If bb is greater than or equal to the length of the string ss, it will become empty. Learning about this, ErnKor became interested in how many pairs (a,b)(a, b) exist for a given nn, satisfying the constraints of the problem, on which K1o0n's solution gives the correct answer.\"The solution gives the correct answer\" means that it outputs a non-empty string, and this string, when converted to an integer, equals the correct answer, i.e., the value of n⋅a−bn \\cdot a - b."

    "description": "ErnKor is ready to do anything for Julen, even to swim through crocodile-infested swamps. We decided to test this love. ErnKor will have to swim across a river with a width of 11 meter and a length of nn meters.The river is very cold. Therefore, in total (that is, throughout the entire swim from 00 to n+1n+1) ErnKor can swim in the water for no more than kk meters. For the sake of humanity, we have added not only crocodiles to the river, but also logs on which he can jump. Our test is as follows:Initially, ErnKor is on the left bank and needs to reach the right bank. They are located at the 00 and n+1n+1 meters respectively. The river can be represented as nn segments, each with a length of 11 meter. Each segment contains either a log 'L', a crocodile 'C', or just water 'W'. ErnKor can move as follows:   If he is on the surface (i.e., on the bank or on a log), he can jump forward for no more than mm (1≤m≤101 \\le m \\le 10) meters (he can jump on the bank, on a log, or in the water).  If he is in the water, he can only swim to the next river segment (or to the bank if he is at the nn-th meter).  ErnKor cannot land in a segment with a crocodile in any way. Determine if ErnKor can reach the right bank."

Similarly, Gorilla came up with the function ff, where f(i)f(i) is the sum of all the numbers in the permutation on a prefix of length ii that are not less than kk. A prefix of length ii is a subarray consisting of the first ii elements of the original array.For example, if n=5n = 5, m=2m = 2, k=5k = 5, and the permutation is [5,3,4,1,2][5, 3, 4, 1, 2], then:  f(1)=5f(1) = 5, because 5≥55 \\ge 5; g(1)=0g(1) = 0, because 5>25 > 2;  f(2)=5f(2) = 5, because 3<53 < 5; g(2)=0g(2) = 0, because 3>23 > 2;  f(3)=5f(3) = 5, because 4<54 < 5; g(3)=0g(3) = 0, because 4>24 > 2;  f(4)=5f(4) = 5, because 1<51 < 5; g(4)=1g(4) = 1, because 1≤21 \\le 2;  f(5)=5f(5) = 5, because 2<52 < 5; g(5)=1+2=3g(5) = 1 + 2 = 3, because 2≤22 \\le 2.

He has cut it into kk pieces, of lengths a1,a2,…,aka_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k meters.k1o0n wasn't keen on that. Luckily, everything can be fixed. In order to do that, k1o0n can do one of the following operations:   Pick a piece with length ai≥2a_i \\ge 2 and divide it into two pieces with lengths 11 and ai−1a_i - 1. As a result, the number of pieces will increase by 11;  Pick a slice aia_i and another slice with length aj=1a_j=1 (i≠ji \\ne j) and merge them into one piece with length ai+1a_i+1. As a result, the number of pieces will decrease by 11. Help k1o0n to find the minimum number of operations he needs to do in order to merge the casserole into one piece with length nn.For example, if n=5n=5, k=2k=2 and a=[3,2]a = [3, 2], it is optimal to do the following:  Divide the piece with length 22 into two pieces with lengths 2−1=12-1=1 and 11, as a result a=[3,1,1]a = [3, 1, 1].  Merge the piece with length 33 and the piece with length 11, as a result a=[4,1]a = [4, 1].  Merge the piece with length 44 and the piece with length 11, as a result a=[5]a = [5]."

Yasya chooses a vertex uu (1≤u≤n1 \\le u \\le n, u≠vu \\neq v) and mentally draws a bidirectional edge of weight xx from vv to uu in the tree.Then Yasya finds a simple cycle in the resulting graph and calculates the bitwise exclusive OR of all the edges in it.

A set of instructions ss consisting of nn instructions of the following types was specially developed for them:  N: move one meter north (from point (x,y)(x, y) to (x,y+1)(x, y + 1));  S: move one meter south (from point (x,y)(x, y) to (x,y−1)(x, y - 1));  E: move one meter east (from point (x,y)(x, y) to (x+1,y)(x + 1, y));  W: move one meter west (from point (x,y)(x, y) to (x−1,y)(x - 1, y)). Each instruction must be executed either by the rover or by the helicopter. Moreover, each device must execute at least one instruction. Your task is to distribute the instructions in such a way that after executing all nn instructions, the helicopter and the rover end up at the same point, or determine that this is impossible."

He encodes this string using the following algorithm:  first, he constructs a new auxiliary string rr, which consists of all distinct letters of the string ss, written in alphabetical order;  then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string ss is replaced by its symmetric character from the string rr (the first character of the string rr will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). For example, encoding the string ss=\"codeforces\" happens as follows:  the string rr is obtained as \"cdefors\";  the first character s1s_1='c' is replaced by 's';  the second character s2s_2='o' is replaced by 'e';  the third character s3s_3='d' is replaced by 'r';  ...  the last character s10s_{10}='s' is replaced by 'c'.   The string rr and replacements for ss=\"codeforces\". Thus, the result of encoding the string ss=\"codeforces\" is the string \"serofedsoc\".Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string ss from the encoding result."

At the beginning of the game, the field contains goals for the two teams (each team can own between one and five goals), the players, and exactly one Quaffle. In this version of the problem, one Bludger and a Golden Snitch can be present.A game is composed of TT steps (0≤T≤100000 \\leq T \\leq 10000). At each step, one entity on the field (a player or a ball) performs one action. All entities can move. A player can also catch a ball or throw the Quaffle that it is carrying. To catch a ball, a player must be located on the same cell as it. The Quaffle does not perform any action while it is being carried; it only follows the movements of the player. If a player carrying the Quaffle decides to throw it, the Quaffle is simply put at the current position of the player. If a player is on the same cell as a Bludger (either after a movement from the player or the Bludger), the player is eliminated. If the player is eliminated while it is carrying the Quaffle, the Quaffle remains on the cell containing both the player and the Bludger after the move. It is guaranteed that this never occurs while the player is in a cell containing a goal.To win a point, a player must leave the Quaffle at a goal of the other team. When it does, the team of the player wins one point, and the Quaffle instantly moves to the middle of the field (the cell at the (M+1)/2(M+1)/2-th column of the (N+1)/2(N+1)/2-th line of the field, starting from 1). There is no goal in the middle of the field. If a player puts the ball in its own goal, the other team wins the point. If a player catches the Golden Snitch, their team wins 10 points and the game is over."

After that, Bob does the following:   if Alice bought less than kk items, Bob can take all of them for free;  otherwise, he will take kk items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which kk items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay bib_i for the ii-th item.

In other words, Alice's profit is the difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying the items.Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit.

Each basic spell simply changes the health of the target: either decreases it or increases it. The ii-th basic spell changes the target's health value by bib_i (increases by bib_i if bib_i is non-negative, or decreases by |bi||b_i| if bib_i is negative). If the target's health value goes to 00 or below, it dies, and all next spells cast at it do nothing.There are also mm composite spells in the spell book, numbered from n+1n+1 to n+mn+m. Each composite spell is a sequence of other spells, cast in specific order. A composite spell can consist both of basic spells and composite spells; the ii-th spell consists of sis_i other spells, and each of those spells has index strictly less than ii (so there is no situation that composite spells infinitely cast each other). So, actually, each composite spell can be considered a finite sequence of basic spells, although its length might be huge. Note that the same spell can appear in a composite spell multiple times.Monocarp has decided to cast the (n+m)(n+m)-th spell from his spell book. The target of this spell is a monster with an initial health value of hphp.

In this game, the player sets up defensive towers that attack enemies moving from a certain starting point to the player's base.You are given a grid of size n×mn \\times m, on which kk towers are already placed and a path is laid out through which enemies will move. The cell at the intersection of the xx-th row and the yy-th column is denoted as (x,y)(x, y).Each second, a tower deals pip_i units of damage to all enemies within its range. For example, if an enemy is located at cell (x,y)(x, y) and a tower is at (xi,yi)(x_i, y_i) with a range of rr, then the enemy will take damage of pip_i if (x−xi)2+(y−yi)2≤r2(x - x_i) ^ 2 + (y - y_i) ^ 2 \\le r ^ 2.Enemies move from cell (1,1)(1, 1) to cell (n,m)(n, m), visiting each cell of the path exactly once. An enemy instantly moves to an adjacent cell horizontally or vertically, but before doing so, it spends one second in the current cell. If its health becomes zero or less during this second, the enemy can no longer move. The player loses if an enemy reaches cell (n,m)(n, m) and can make one more move.By default, all towers have a zero range, but the player can set a tower's range to an integer rr (r>0r > 0), in which case the health of all enemies will increase by 3r3^r. However, each rr can only be used for at most one tower.Suppose an enemy has a base health of hh units. If the tower ranges are 22, 44, and 55, then the enemy's health at the start of the path will be h+32+34+35=h+9+81+243=h+333h + 3 ^ 2 + 3 ^ 4 + 3 ^ 5 = h + 9 + 81 + 243 = h + 333. The choice of ranges is made once before the appearance of enemies and cannot be changed after the game starts.Find the maximum amount of base health hh for which it is possible to set the ranges so that the player does not lose when an enemy with health hh passes through (without considering the additions for tower ranges)."

The greatest common divisor of two numbers aa and bb is the largest number that divides both aa and bb without leaving a remainder. With this knowledge, Egor can solve a problem that he once couldn't.Vasily has a grid with nn rows and mm columns, and the integer aij{a_i}_j is located at the intersection of the ii-th row and the jj-th column. Egor wants to go from the top left corner (at the intersection of the first row and the first column) to the bottom right corner (at the intersection of the last row and the last column) and find the greatest common divisor of all the numbers along the path. He is only allowed to move down and to the right. Egor has written down several paths and obtained different GCD values. He became interested in finding the maximum possible GCD.Unfortunately, Egor is tired of calculating GCDs, so he asks for your help in finding the maximum GCD of the integers along the path from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of the grid."

Initially, Alice and Bob play with nn numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence, then Alice and Bob play with n−1n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after which Alice and Bob play with n−2n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty.Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants Bob to win as many times as possible.

    "description": "In the classic high-performance computing domain (HPC), the vast majority of computations are conducted in double-precision 64-bit floating-point numbers (fp64, double-precision, IEEE-754 binary64). The rise of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) resulted in hardware (HW) capable of processing 16-bit floating point numbers (fp16, half precision, IEEE-754 binary16) up to 16 times faster in terms of floating-point operations per second (flops) and up to 4 times faster in terms of memory bandwidth (BW). At the same time, the short mantissa and exponent for fp16 numbers lead to a very fast loss of precision of computations, producing wrong computational results without any option to recover them in reduction operations of size greater than approximately 20002000. As the typical problem size in HPC is much larger than 20002000, this makes fp16 computations almost useless. To surmount this major roadblock, smarter algorithms for reduction operations are needed.Description. There is a sequence of floating-point numbers stored in IEEE-754 binary64 (double precision, fp64) format xix_i of length NN. The sequence needs to be summed up to S=x1+x2+…+xNS = x_1 + x_2 + \\ldots + x_N. As professional computer equipment with native support for fp16 is usually unavailable to the general audience, we propose to do operations in a simplified simulated environment, that is, we do computations in fp64 format with mantissa and exponent cut to the range admissible in fp16. In particular, small values that do not fit fp16 admissible range turn into zeros, while excessively large values turn into infinities. Objective. Your objective is to sum up as many sequences as possible as fast as possible and as accurately as possible. Please note that you may do summation in fp64 format, but the summation process would be slow though accurate. If you do plain summation in fp16 format, it can be fast, but inaccurate, especially for larger sequences."

In each step of such a movement, her body first shrinks by one pixel (one pixel of the body is removed and becomes free), and then grows at a different place (one previously-free pixel is added to the body).To prevent structural damage, Amanda's body always occupies a connected region of pixels, which means that any pair of pixels forming the body can be connected by a sequence of adjacent pixels without ever leaving the body. Two pixels are considered adjacent if they share a common side (each pixel has at most 4 neighbours). The body remains connected even during the movement, including the moment after removing a pixel and before adding another one.Your task is to help Amanda find her way around. Given her initial position and desired final position, suggest a sequence of valid moves leading from the former to the latter.

A permutation of length nn is an array consisting of nn distinct integers from 11 to nn in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4][2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2][1,2,2] is not a permutation (22 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4][1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3n=3 but there is 44 in the array).You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary search, the array must be sorted.You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more than 22 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices ii, jj (1≤i,j≤n1\\le i, j \\le n) and swap the elements at positions ii and jj.After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm, two variables l=1l = 1 and r=n+1r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is executed:  If r−l=1r - l = 1, end the loop  m=⌊r+l2⌋m = \\lfloor \\frac{r + l}{2} \\rfloor  If pm≤xp_m \\le x, assign l=ml = m, otherwise r=mr = m.

At the start of the game, all cards are in the randomly shuffled deck.Bessie starts the game by drawing the top 55 cards of the deck.

Rudolf can choose the row (i,1),(i,2),…,(i,m)(i,1), (i,2), \\ldots, (i,m) and build a bridge over it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost of installing a support in the cell (i,j)(i,j) is ai,j+1a_{i,j}+1. Supports must be installed so that the following conditions are met:  A support must be installed in cell (i,1)(i,1);  A support must be installed in cell (i,m)(i,m);  The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than dd.

The transition can be made clockwise or counterclockwise.Let's call the clockwise (counterclockwise) distance from player y1y_1 to player y2y_2 the number of transitions clockwise (counterclockwise) that need to be made to move from player y1y_1 to player y2y_2. For example, if n=7n=7 then the clockwise distance from 22 to 55 is 33, and the counterclockwise distance from 22 to 55 is 44.Initially, the ball is with the player number xx (players are numbered clockwise). On the ii-th move the person with the ball throws it at a distance of rir_i (1≤ri≤n−11 \\le r_i \\le n - 1) clockwise or counterclockwise.

An illustration of this example is shown below.  The game was interrupted after mm throws due to unexpected rain. When the rain stopped, the guys gathered again to continue.

If Timofey stole vertex vv from the tree, then vertex vv and all edges with one end at vertex vv are removed from the tree, while the numbers of other vertices remain unchanged. To prevent Andrey from getting upset, Timofey decided to make the resulting graph a tree again. To do this, he can add edges between any vertices aa and bb, but when adding such an edge, he must pay |a−b||a - b| coins to the Master's Assistance Center.Note that the resulting tree does not contain vertex vv.Timofey has not yet decided which vertex vv he will remove from the tree, so he wants to know for each vertex 1≤v≤n1 \\leq v \\leq n, the minimum number of coins needed to be spent to make the graph a tree again after removing vertex vv, as well as which edges need to be added.†^{\\dagger}A tree is an undirected connected graph without cycles."

Each cell can either be empty or have a single fortune cookie of one of the following shapes: circle or square.

In this world, the columns are cyclic (i.e. the top and the bottom cells in each column are adjacent). The cell on the ii-th row and the jj-th column (0≤i<n,0≤j<m0 \\le i < n, 0 \\le j < m) is denoted as (i,j)(i,j). At time 00, the cell (i,j)(i,j) (where 0≤i<n,0≤j<m0 \\le i < n, 0 \\le j < m) contains either a rock or nothing. The state of cell (i,j)(i,j) can be described using the integer ai,ja_{i,j}:   If ai,j=1a_{i,j} = 1, there is a rock at (i,j)(i,j).  If ai,j=0a_{i,j} = 0, there is nothing at (i,j)(i,j). As a result of aftershocks from the earthquake, the columns follow tectonic plate movements: each column moves cyclically upwards at a velocity of 11 cell per unit of time. Formally, for some 0≤i<n,0≤j<m0 \\le i < n, 0 \\le j < m, if (i,j)(i,j) contains a rock at the moment, it will move from (i,j)(i, j) to (i−1,j)(i - 1, j) (or to (n−1,j)(n - 1, j) if i=0i=0). The robot called RT is initially positioned at (0,0)(0,0). It has to go to (n−1,m−1)(n-1,m-1) to carry out an earthquake rescue operation (to the bottom rightmost cell). The earthquake doesn't change the position of the robot, they only change the position of rocks in the world.Let RT's current position be (x,y)(x,y) (0≤x<n,0≤y<m0 \\le x < n, 0 \\le y < m), it can perform the following operations:   Go one cell cyclically upwards, i.e. from (x,y)(x,y) to ((x+n−1)modn,y)((x+n-1) \\bmod n, y) using 11 unit of time.  Go one cell cyclically downwards, i.e. (x,y)(x,y) to ((x+1)modn,y)((x+1) \\bmod n, y) using 11 unit of time.  Go one cell to the right, i.e. (x,y)(x,y) to (x,y+1)(x, y+1) using 11 unit of time. (RT may perform this operation only if y<m−1y < m-1.) Note that RT cannot go left using the operations nor can he stay at a position.Unfortunately, RT will explode upon colliding with a rock. As such, when RT is at (x,y)(x,y) and there is a rock at ((x+1)modn,y)((x+1) \\bmod n, y) or ((x+2)modn,y)((x+2) \\bmod n, y), RT cannot move down or it will be hit by the rock.   Similarly, if y+1<my+1 < m and there is a rock at ((x+1)modn,y+1)((x+1) \\bmod n, y+1), RT cannot move right or it will be hit by the rock.  However, it is worth noting that if there is a rock at (xmodn,y+1)(x \\bmod n, y+1) and ((x+1)modn,y)((x+1) \\bmod n, y), RT can still move right safely.  Find the minimum amount of time RT needs to reach (n−1,m−1)(n-1,m-1) without colliding with any rocks. If it is impossible to do so, output −1-1."

He knows that exactly 11 student is absent today. In order to determine who is absent, he can ask some queries to the class. In each query, he can provide two integers ll and rr (1≤l≤r≤n1\\leq l\\leq r\\leq n) and all students whose roll numbers are between ll and rr (inclusive) will raise their hands. He then counts them to determine if the roll number of the absent student lies between these values.Things seemed fine until his teaching assistant noticed something — the students are dishonest! Some students whose roll numbers lie in the given range may not raise their hands, while some other students whose roll number does not lie in the given range may raise their hands. But the students don't want to raise much suspicion. So, only the following 44 cases are possible for a particular query (l,r)(l,r) —   True Positive: r−l+1r-l+1 students are present and r−l+1r-l+1 students raised their hands.

So, their strategy always meets the following two conditions —   The students will never answer honestly 33 times in a row.  The students will never answer dishonestly 33 times in a row. Mr. 1048576 is frustrated by this act of students. So, he is willing to mark at most 22 students as absent (though he knows that only one is).

These are extraordinary subsequences where the sum of every three consecutive numbers is even, and each subsequence must be at least three numbers in length. Given a sequence aia_i (1≤i≤n1 \\le i \\le n) of length nn, its subsequence of length mm is equal to ab1,ab2,…,abma_{b_1}, a_{b_2}, \\ldots, a_{b_m} and is uniquely defined by a set of mm indices bjb_j, such that 1≤b1<b2<…<bm≤n1 \\le b_1 < b_2 < \\ldots < b_m \\le n. Subsequences given by different sets of indices bjb_j are considered different.There's a twist in Kim's quest: the number of these Harmonious Subsequences could be overwhelming.

    "description": "The city of F. can be represented as a tree. A famous fugitive is hiding in it, and today a faithful police officer decided to catch him at all costs. The police officer is stronger than the fugitive, but the fugitive is much faster than the former. That is why the pursuit proceeds as follows. At the moment t=0t = 0 the police officer appears at the vertex with number ss, and the fugitive spawns at any other vertex of his choice. After that, they take turns, starting with the police officer.  During the police officer's move, she selects any vertex adjacent to the one where she is currently located and moves there. The police officer spends one minute moving. Also, the police officer may decide to stand still instead, in which case she waits one minute at the vertex at which she started her move. If at the end of the turn the police officer ends up at the same vertex as the fugitive, she instantly catches him and the chase ends.  The fugitive's move is as follows. Let him be at vertex bb, and the police officer at vertex pp. Then the fugitive chooses any vertex b′≠pb' \\ne p such that the path between the vertices bb and b′b' does not contain vertex pp and instantly moves there. In particular, he can always choose b′=bb' = b to stay where he is. The fugitive's move takes no time. Note that the fugitive managed to attach a radio bug to the police officer's badge a week ago, so the fugitive knows the location of the police officer at every moment (in particular, he knows the number ss). On the contrary, the police officer knows nothing about the fugitive's movements and will only be able to detect him at the very moment she catches him.The police officer aims to catch the fugitive as fast as possible, and the fugitive aims to be caught as late as possible. Since the chase can be thought of as a game with incomplete information, participants can use mixed (probabilistic) strategies — thus, the police officer acts to minimize the expected duration of the chase, and the fugitive — to maximize it.Find the mathematical expectation of the duration of the chase with optimal actions of the police officer and the fugitive. It can be proven that it is always finite. In particular, with optimal strategies, the probability that the chase continues indefinitely is equal to zero."

    "description": "Daisy has recently learned divisibility rules for integers and she is fascinated by them. One of the tests she learned is a divisibility test by 3. You can find a sum of all digits of a decimal number and check if the resulting sum is divisible by 3. Moreover, the resulting sum of digits is congruent modulo 3 to the original number — the remainder modulo 3 is preserved. For example, 75 \\equiv 7 + 5 \\pmod 375 \\equiv 7 + 5 \\pmod 3. Daisy is specifically interested in such remainder preserving divisibility tests.There are more examples like that that she learned for decimal integers (integers base 10):  To test divisibility modulo 11, find an alternating sum of digits. Counting digits from the last (least significant) digit, add digits on odd positions (the last, 3rd to the last, etc) and subtract digits on even positions (2nd to the last, 4th to the last, etc) to get the sum that is congruent modulo 11 to the original number. For example, 123 \\equiv 1 - 2 + 3 \\pmod {11}123 \\equiv 1 - 2 + 3 \\pmod {11}.  To test divisibility modulo 4, keep the last two digits. Their value is congruent modulo 4 to the original number. For example, 876543 \\equiv 43 \\pmod 4876543 \\equiv 43 \\pmod 4.  To test divisibility modulo 7, find an alternating sum of groups of three digits. For example, 4389328 \\equiv 4 - 389 + 328 \\pmod 74389328 \\equiv 4 - 389 + 328 \\pmod 7. Similar tests can be found in other bases. For example, to test divisibility modulo 5 for octal numbers (base 8), find an alternating sum of groups of two digits. For example, 1234_8 \\equiv -12_8 + 34_8 \\pmod 51234_8 \\equiv -12_8 + 34_8 \\pmod 5.Daisy wants to find such rules for a given base bb. She is interested in three kinds of divisibility rules:  Kind 1 — take the last kk digits of an integer in base bb.  Kind 2 — take a sum of groups of kk digits of an integer in base bb.  Kind 3 — take an alternating sum of groups of kk digits of an integer in base bb. It is not always possible to find such a divisibility rule. For example, in base 10 there is no such test for divisibility modulo 6, even though different approaches to testing divisibility by 6 exist.Given base bb and modulo nn, Daisy wants to know the smallest group size kk for which such a divisibility test exits."

At each of the left and right sides there is a window seat, a middle seat, and an aisle seat. A passenger that boards an aircraft assigned to an aisle seat takes significantly less time than a passenger assigned to a window seat even when there is no one else in the aircraft.The company decided to compute an inconvenience of a layout as the total sum of distances from each of the seats of a single row to the closest aisle. The distance from a seat to an aisle is the number of seats between them. For a 3-3 layout, a window seat has a distance of 2, a middle seat — 1, and an aisle seat — 0. The inconvenience of a 3-3 layout is (2+1+0)+(0+1+2)=6(2+1+0)+(0+1+2)=6. The inconvenience of a 3-5-3 layout is (2+1+0)+(0+1+2+1+0)+(0+1+2)=10(2+1+0)+(0+1+2+1+0)+(0+1+2)=10.Formally, a layout is a sequence of positive integers a1,a2,…,ak+1a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{k+1} — group ii having aia_i seats, with kk aisles between groups, the ii-th aisle being between groups ii and i+1i+1.

    "description": "You are currently researching the Merge Sort algorithm. Merge Sort is a sorting algorithm that is based on the principle of Divide and Conquer. It works by dividing an array into two subarrays of equal length, sorting each subarrays, then merging the sorted subarrays back together to form the final sorted array.You are particularly interested in the merging routine. Common merge implementation will combine two subarrays by iteratively comparing their first elements, and move the smaller one to a new merged array. More precisely, the merge algorithm can be presented by the following pseudocode.    Merge(A[1..N], B[1..N]):        C = []        i = 1        j = 1        while i <= N AND j <= N:            if A[i] < B[j]:                append A[i] to C                i = i + 1            else:                append B[j] to C                j = j + 1         while i <= N:            append A[i] to C            i = i + 1         while j <= N:            append B[j] to C            j = j + 1         return CDuring your research, you are keen to understand the behaviour of the merge algorithm when arrays AA and BB are not necessarily sorted. For example, if A=[3,1,6]A = [3, 1, 6] and B=[4,5,2]B = [4, 5, 2], then Merge(A,B)=[3,1,4,5,2,6]\\text{Merge}(A, B) = [3, 1, 4, 5, 2, 6].To further increase the understanding of the merge algorithm, you decided to work on the following problem. You are given an array CC of length 2⋅N2 \\cdot N such that it is a permutation of 11 to 2⋅N2 \\cdot N. Construct any two arrays AA and BB of the same length NN, such that Merge(A,B)=C\\text{Merge}(A, B) = C, or determine if it is impossible to do so."

The game consists of 333333 rounds and you have to win all rounds in order to escape. The demon also gives you 999999 coins that you can use throughout all rounds.Note that in this problem, denote cell (r,c)(r, c) of a grid as the cell in row rr and column cc of the grid.Before the start of each round, the demon will prepare a secret paper, which can be represented as a grid with 33 rows and 33 columns, both numbered from 11 to 33. The demon will secretly put a hole in one or more cells, and you are not aware which cells have a hole in it. Then, the round starts with the demon giving you an odd integer NN (3≤N≤333 \\leq N \\leq 33).Within each round, you can ask the demon several queries, each costing you one coin. For each query, you are allowed to give the demon your paper, which can be represented as a grid with NN rows and NN columns, both numbered from 11 to NN. Each cell is coloured either black or white by you.For each of your query, the demon will calculate a binary result grid with N−2N - 2 rows and N−2N - 2 columns, both numbered from 11 to N−2N - 2. The value on cell (r,c)(r, c) of the result grid is filled as follows.  The demon will put the secret paper on top of your paper such that the cell (r+i−1,c+j−1)(r + i - 1, c + j - 1) of your paper aligns with the cell (i,j)(i, j) of the secret paper, for 1≤i,j≤31 \\leq i, j \\leq 3.  The demon can only see the colour of the cell in your paper if the corresponding cell in the secret paper has a hole in it.  The value on cell (r,c)(r, c) of the result grid is 11 if there is an odd number of black cells that it can see through the holes, or 00 otherwise. You win the round if the result grid consists of only the values 11. Otherwise, the demon will give you the result grid as a feedback, and the round continues.If you have spent all the coins and still did not win all the rounds, then you will be trapped forever.

Let's see how this spell works.Firstly, Vasya chooses an index ii of some monster (1≤i≤n1 \\le i \\le n) and the initial power of the spell xx. Then the spell hits monsters exactly nn times, one hit per monster. The first target of the spell is always the monster ii. For every target except for the first one, the chain lightning will choose a random monster who was not hit by the spell and is adjacent to one of the monsters that already was hit. So, each monster will be hit exactly once. The first monster hit by the spell receives xx damage, the second monster receives (x−1)(x-1) damage, the third receives (x−2)(x-2) damage, and so on.Vasya wants to show how powerful he is, so he wants to kill all the monsters with a single chain lightning spell. The monster is considered dead if the damage he received is not less than the amount of its health points. On the other hand, Vasya wants to show he doesn't care that much, so he wants to choose the minimum initial power of the spell xx such that it kills all monsters, no matter which monster (among those who can get hit) gets hit on each step.Of course, Vasya is a sorcerer, but the amount of calculations required to determine the optimal spell setup is way above his possibilities, so you have to help him find the minimum spell power required to kill all the monsters.Note that Vasya chooses the initial target and the power of the spell, other things should be considered random and Vasya wants to kill all the monsters even in the worst possible scenario."

Note that both actions are part of the operation, and for one operation, you must apply both actions.For example, if you apply the operation to the array [4,3,1,2,6,44, 3, 1, 2, 6, 4], it will change as follows: [4,3,1,2,6,4\\color{red}{4}, 3, 1, 2, 6, 4]; [3,1,2,6,4,43, 1, 2, 6, 4, \\color{red}{4}]; [3,1,2,6,4,43, 1, 2, 6, \\color{red}{4}, 4]; [3,1,2,4,6,43, 1, 2, \\color{red}{4}, 6, 4].Vlad doesn't have time to perform all the operations, so he asks you to determine the minimum number of operations required to sort the array or report that it is impossible."

    "description": "Yarik is a big fan of many kinds of music. But Yarik loves not only listening to music but also writing it. He likes electronic music most of all, so he has created his own system of music notes, which, in his opinion, is best for it.Since Yarik also likes informatics, in his system notes are denoted by integers of 2k2^k, where k≥1k \\ge 1 — a positive integer. But, as you know, you can't use just notes to write music, so Yarik uses combinations of two notes. The combination of two notes (a,b)(a, b), where a=2ka = 2^k and b=2lb = 2^l, he denotes by the integer aba^b.For example, if a=8=23a = 8 = 2^3, b=4=22b = 4 = 2^2, then the combination (a,b)(a, b) is denoted by the integer ab=84=4096a^b = 8^4 = 4096. Note that different combinations can have the same notation, e.g., the combination (64,2)(64, 2) is also denoted by the integer 4096=6424096 = 64^2.Yarik has already chosen nn notes that he wants to use in his new melody. However, since their integers can be very large, he has written them down as an array aa of length nn, then the note ii is bi=2aib_i = 2^{a_i}. The integers in array aa can be repeated.The melody will consist of several combinations of two notes. Yarik was wondering how many pairs of notes bi,bjb_i, b_j (i<j)(i < j) exist such that the combination (bi,bj)(b_i, b_j) is equal to the combination (bj,bi)(b_j, b_i). In other words, he wants to count the number of pairs (i,j)(i, j) (i<j)(i < j) such that bbji=bbijb_i^{b_j} = b_j^{b_i}. Help him find the number of such pairs."

The characteristic of the sequence aa is defined as the sequence r1,r2,…,rnr_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_n.  Unfortunately, the sequence aa got lost, but you still have its characteristic rr. You want to reconstruct any sequence aa that matches the characteristic, or determine that there is an error in the characteristic and such a sequence does not exist."

    "url": "https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1885/A",
    "description": "Background Extended reality (XR) service is a promising application for future communications. In wireless communications, XR data are transmitted over radio between base stations and mobile terminals. A region is usually divided into multiple cells, each of which is equipped with a base station to serve users. One base station usually serves multiple users, and multiple base stations may serve one user at the same time.TaskThe task of this competition is to design a scheduling algorithm for XR service. By properly allocating radio resources, we want to maximize the number of XR data frames that are successfully transmitted. A diagram is provided below for illustration: The transmission of a data frame is failed when it cannot be completely transmitted during the permitted transmission time window.      Therefore, the objective of this task can be modeled as: P:max∑jfj \\mathcal{P}: \\max \\sum_j f_j \\tag{1}  fj={1,gj≥TBSj0,gj<TBSj f_j=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c} 1, g_j \\geq T B S_j \\\\ 0, g_j< T B S_j \\end{array}\\right. \\tag{2}  Here, fjf_j represents the transmission result of the jj-th frame: when the actual transmitted bits gjg_j (computed via (5)) is not less than the size of the frame, i.e., TBSjTBS_j (transport block size), the frame would be successfully transmitted so that fj=1f_j=1. Otherwise, fj=0f_j=0.To achieve better user experience, scheduling algorithm should be proposed to efficiently assign the limited radio resources:   Time domain resource, which is divided into several transmission time intervals (TTIs), each TTI corresponds to a transmission time of 0.50.5ms.  Frequency domain resource, which is divided into several resource block groups (Resource Block Group, RBG), each RBG corresponds to a transmission bandwidth of 57605760 kHz.  Power domain resource: each cell has a fixed maximum transmission power to serve users. Summarily, two optimization variables are introduced to represent the scheduling result: b(k)rnt∈{0,1} b_{r n t}^{(k)} \\in\\{0,1\\} \\tag{3}  p(k)rnt≥0,∑r∑np(k)rnt≤R,∑np(k)rnt≤4 p_{ {rnt }}^{(k)} \\geq 0 , \\quad \\sum_r \\sum_n p_{ {rnt }}^{(k)} \\leq R, \\quad \\sum_n p_{ {rnt }}^{(k)} \\leq 4 \\tag{4}  Here, b(k)rntb_{rnt}^{(k)} is a Boolean variable denoting whether the rr-th RBG of cell kk is allocated to user nn at TTI tt, and p(k)rntp_{rnt}^{(k)} is a nonnegative continuous variable denoting the power allocated to user nn in the rr-th RBG of cell kk at TTI tt. For each TTI of each cell, the power range of each RBG is between 00 and 44, and the total power of all RBGs can not be larger than RR.When the radio resources are allocated to the users, the XR data transmission can be provided for them. Assume that the jj-th frame belongs to the nn-th user, the actual transmitted bits for the frame, i.e., gjg_j can be given by:gj=W×t1,j∑t=t0,j∑k∑rb(k)rnt×log2(1+s(k)nt). g_{j}= W\\times \\sum_{t=t_{0, j}}^{t_{1, j}} \\sum_k \\sum_r b_{r n t}^{(k)} \\times \\log _2\\left(1+s_{n t}^{(k)}\\right). \\tag{5}  Note that W×log2(1+s(k)nt)W\\times \\mathrm{log}_2 (1+s_{nt}^{(k)} )  is the well-known Shannon formula, which represents the transmitted data volume, where s(k)nts_{nt}^{(k)} represents the transmission SINR (Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio) of user nn in cell kk at TTI tt, and W=192W=192 is the constant number of available frequency resounce elements of one RBG. t0,jt_{0,j} and t1,jt_{1,j} denote the start TTI and the end TTI of frame jj, respectively. The physical meaning of Formula (5) is that the number of bits transmitted within the valid time period, t0,j∼t1,jt_{0,j}\\sim t_{1,j}, will be counted as valid transmission bits for the jj-th frame. Finally, we give the expression of SINR, which may be complicated but corresponds to the actual physical transmission:s(k)nt=(∏r,b(k)rnt=1s(k)rnt)1∑rb(k)rnt s_{nt}^{\\left( k \\right)} = {\\left( {\\prod\\limits_{r,b_{rnt}^{\\left( k \\right)} = 1} {s_{rnt}^{\\left( k \\right)}} } \\right)^{\\frac{1}{{\\sum\\nolimits_r {b_{rnt}^{\\left( k \\right)}} }}}} \\tag{6}  s(k)rnt=s(k)0,rnt×p(k)rnt×∏m≠ned(k)mrn×b(k)rmt1+∑k′≠k,n′≠ns(k′)0,rnt×p(k′)rn′t×e−d(k′)n′rn s_{r n t}^{(k)}=\\frac{s_{0, r n t}^{(k)} \\times p_{r n t}^{(k)} \\times \\prod_{m \\neq n} e^{d^{(k)}_{mrn} \\times b_{r m t}^{(k)}}}{1+\\sum_{k^{\\prime} \\neq k, n^{\\prime} \\neq n} s_{0, r n t}^{(k^{\\prime})} \\times p_{r n^{\\prime} t}^{\\left(k^{\\prime}\\right)} \\times e^{-d^{(k^{\\prime})}_{n^{\\prime}rn}}} \\tag{7} Formula (6) shows the computation of user-level effective SINR: the transmission SINR of user nn, i.e., s(k)nts_{nt}^{(k)}, is the geometric mean of the SINRs of scheduled RBGs. Then, formula (7) shows the computation of RBG-level effective SINR. s(k)0,rnts_{0,rnt}^{(k)} is a given constant denoting the initial SINR on RBG rr of cell kk at TTI tt, which indicates the quality of the channel. Another given constant value d(k)mrnd^{(k)}_{mrn} represents the interference factor between user mm and user nn on RBG rr, when user mm is scheduled on cell kk. Note that d(k)mrn=d(k)nrm≤0d^{(k)}_{mrn}=d^{(k)}_{nrm}\\le 0, which reveals that scheduling multiple users on the same RBG-TTI resource will cause a decrease in the SINR of each user.To sum up, participants are required to find an efficient radio resource allocation, so that more XR data frames can be successfully transmitted.

For example, the strings \"anna\", \"aboba\", \"level\" are palindromes, while the strings \"gorilla\", \"banan\", \"off\" are not.A substring [l…r][l \\ldots r] of string ss is a string slsl+1…sr−1srs_l s_{l+1} \\ldots s_{r-1} s_r.

If you use some other programming language, consult its documentation. You may also refer to the guide on interactive problems: https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/45307.You are given a tree on nn vertices; vertex 11 is the root of the tree. For every i∈[2,n]i \\in [2, n], the parent of the ii-th vertex is pip_i, and pi<ip_i < i.You have to color all edges of the tree using the minimum possible number of colors such that you can win the game on that tree (every edge should be painted into exactly one color).The game we're going to play will be conducted as follows. After you paint the edges and print their colors, the jury will place a chip into one of the vertices of the tree (except for the root). Your goal is to move this chip to the root in exactly dd moves, where dd is the distance from the root to that vertex (the distance is equal to the number of edges on the path). If the chip reaches the root in dd moves, you win. Otherwise, you lose.The jury won't tell you where the chip is located. You won't even know the value of dd in advance. However, at the start of each move, you will be told how many edges of each color are incident to the current vertex (this includes both the edge leading up the tree and the edges leading away from the root). You have to choose one of these colors, and the chip will be moved along the edge of the chosen color (if there are multiple edges with that color incident to the current vertex, the jury gets to choose one of them). After the chip is moved, you will be told the same information about the current vertex again, and the game continues, until you either reach the root, or you make dd moves without reaching the root.The interactor for this problem is adaptive. It means that both the starting vertex and the current vertex are not fixed and may change \"on the run\" depending on the output of your program. However, the state of the game will always be consistent with the information you are given: there will always be at least one starting vertex and at least one path of your chip from that vertex consistent with both the information about the colors you receive and the colors you've chosen during the moves."

The 11-st athlete is Monocarp's friend Polycarp, and Monocarp really wants Polycarp to win.The competition will be conducted as follows. The jury will choose a positive (greater than zero) integer ww, which denotes the weight of the barbell that will be used in the competition. The goal for each athlete is to lift the barbell as many times as possible. The athlete who lifts the barbell the most amount of times will be declared the winner (if there are multiple such athletes — there's no winner).If the barbell's weight ww is strictly greater than the strength of the ii-th athlete sis_i, then the ii-th athlete will be unable to lift the barbell even one single time. Otherwise, the ii-th athlete will be able to lift the barbell, and the number of times he does it will be equal to his endurance eie_i.For example, suppose there are 44 athletes with parameters s1=7,e1=4s_1 = 7, e_1 = 4; s2=9,e2=3s_2 = 9, e_2 = 3; s3=4,e3=6s_3 = 4, e_3 = 6; s4=2,e4=2s_4 = 2, e_4 = 2. If the weight of the barbell is 55, then:  the first athlete will be able to lift the barbell 44 times;  the second athlete will be able to lift the barbell 33 times;  the third athlete will be unable to lift the barbell;  the fourth athlete will be unable to lift the barbell. Monocarp wants to choose ww in such a way that Polycarp (the 11-st athlete) wins the competition. Help him to choose the value of ww, or report that it is impossible."

More precisely, animal ii is afraid of animal aia_i (ai≠ia_i \\neq i). Also, the cost of each animal is known, for animal ii it is equal to cic_i.You will sell all your animals in some fixed order. Formally, you will need to choose some permutation†^\\dagger p1,p2,…,pnp_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n, and sell animal p1p_1 first, then animal p2p_2, and so on, selling animal pnp_n last.When you sell animal ii, there are two possible outcomes: If animal aia_i was sold before animal ii, you receive cic_i money for selling animal ii. If animal aia_i was not sold before animal ii, you receive 2⋅ci2 \\cdot c_i money for selling animal ii. (Surprisingly, animals that are currently afraid are more valuable). Your task is to choose the order of selling the animals in order to maximize the total profit. For example, if a=[3,4,4,1,3]a = [3, 4, 4, 1, 3], c=[3,4,5,6,7]c = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7], and the permutation you choose is [4,2,5,1,3][4, 2, 5, 1, 3], then: The first animal to be sold is animal 44. Animal a4=1a_4 = 1 was not sold before, so you receive 2⋅c4=122 \\cdot c_4 = 12 money for selling it. The second animal to be sold is animal 22. Animal a2=4a_2 = 4 was sold before, so you receive c2=4c_2 = 4 money for selling it. The third animal to be sold is animal 55. Animal a5=3a_5 = 3 was not sold before, so you receive 2⋅c5=142 \\cdot c_5 = 14 money for selling it. The fourth animal to be sold is animal 11.

There exists KK distinct special tiles on the chessboard with the ii-th special tile being tile (Xi,Yi)(X_i,Y_i). It is guaranteed that tile (1,1)(1,1) is not a special tile.A new chess piece has been invented, which is the castle. The castle moves similarly to a rook in regular chess, but slightly differently. In one move, a castle that is on some tile can only move to another tile in the same row or in the same column, but only in the right direction or the down direction. Formally, in one move, the castle on tile (r,c)(r,c) can only move to tile (r′,c′)(r',c') if and only if one of the following two conditions is satisfied:   r′=rr'=r and c′>cc'>c.  c′=cc'=c and r′>rr'>r. Chaneka and Bhinneka will play a game. In the beginning of the game, there is a castle in tile (1,1)(1,1). The two players will play alternatingly with Chaneka going first. In one turn, the player on that turn must move the castle following the movement rules of the castle.If a player moves the castle to a special tile on her turn, then that player wins the game and the game ends. If on a turn, the castle cannot be moved, the player on that turn loses and the game ends.Given the size of the board and the locations of each special tile. Determine the winner of this game if Chaneka and Bhinneka plays optimally."

However, for each day where there is a person currently in floor xx who wants to go to floor yy, among all elevator movements done by Pak Chanek, the following must happen:   One elevator moves to floor xx.  The person gets into the elevator.  The elevator moves to floor yy.  The person gets out of the elevator. For each day, Pak Chanek can only move the elevators that are currently on. Note that, since a change in state happens at the start of the day, this means that an elevator that turns off on some day starts becoming unusable from that day itself. Conversely, an elevator that turns on on some day starts becoming usable from that day itself.It is known that the electricity fee for each day is different. More specifically, on the jj-th day, the fee needed to move one elevator up or down by one floor is AjA_j.From the start, Pak Chanek already knows the electricity fees and the sequence of events that will happen on the QQ days, so Pak Chanek can operate the elevators strategically.

Each leaf has a hunger value, we denote the hunger value of leaf vv by hvh_v.Each inner vertex of the tree has a selector pointing to one of the children of the vertex.This tree accepts cookies. Before launching the process you can choose the initial state of each selector individually. The process is as follows:  Initially there are no cookies in vertices.  You insert cookies into the root one by one.  As long as the cookie is not in a leaf, it falls to the child defined by the selector in the current vertex. This selector then changes its state to the opposite one, i. e. it starts pointing to the other child of the vertex.  You stop inserting cookies when each leaf vv has at least hvh_v cookies in it. In this case, we say that the tree is filled up. You have qq queries. Each query changes the value of hvh_v for some leaf vv. You need to print q+1q + 1 numbers, the ii-th of them being the minimum number of cookies required to fill up the machine after (i−1)(i - 1) updates if you can pick any initial state for every selector. Since these numbers may be very large, print the answers modulo 998244353998\\,244\\,353.Please note that you can choose the initial state of all selectors independently between queries. However, the queries themselves are not independent: when answering the ii-th query, you should also consider the effect of queries 1,2,…,i−11, 2, \\ldots, i - 1."

On the other hand, 11010 is not balanced, because the number of subsequences 01 is 11, but the number of subsequences 10 is 55.

During the first move, Alice chooses any element of the permutation and places the chip on that element. During each of the next moves, the current player has to move the chip to any element that is simultaneously to the left and strictly less than the current element (i. e. if the chip is on the ii-th element, it can be moved to the jj-th element if j<ij < i and pj<pip_j < p_i). If a player cannot make a move (it is impossible to move the chip according to the rules of the game), that player wins the game.Let's say that the ii-th element of the permutation is lucky if the following condition holds:  if Alice places the chip on the ii-th element during her first move, she can win the game no matter how Bob plays (i. e. she has a winning strategy). You have to calculate the number of lucky elements in the permutation."

Then we can construct a path of length 66 consisting of 22 blocks:c1→c3→c4→c11→c12→c14\\color{red}{c_1} \\rightarrow \\color{red}{c_3} \\rightarrow \\color{red}{c_4} \\rightarrow \\color{blue}{c_{11}} \\rightarrow \\color{blue}{c_{12}} \\rightarrow \\color{blue}{c_{14}}All tiles from the 11-st block will have colour 1\\color{red}{\\textbf{1}}, from the 22-nd block will have colour 4\\color{blue}{\\textbf{4}}.It is also possible to construct a path of length 99 in this example, in which all tiles from the 11-st block will have colour 1\\color{red}{\\textbf{1}}, from the 22-nd block will have colour 3\\color{green}{\\textbf{3}}, and from the 33-rd block will have colour 4\\color{blue}{\\textbf{4}}."

Two people with heights aa and bb can have a conversation on the escalator if they are standing on different steps and the height difference between them is equal to the height difference between the steps.For example, if two people have heights 170170 and 180180 centimeters, and m=10,k=5m = 10, k = 5, then they can stand on steps numbered 77 and 55, where the height difference between the steps is equal to the height difference between the two people: k⋅2=5⋅2=10=180−170k \\cdot 2 = 5 \\cdot 2 = 10 = 180 - 170. There are other possible ways.Given an array hh of size nn, where hih_i represents the height of the ii-th person. Vlad is interested in how many people he can have a conversation with on the escalator individually.For example, if n=5,m=3,k=3,H=11n = 5, m = 3, k = 3, H = 11, and h=[5,4,14,18,2]h = [5, 4, 14, 18, 2], Vlad can have a conversation with the person with height 55 (Vlad will stand on step 11, and the other person will stand on step 33) and with the person with height 1414 (for example, Vlad can stand on step 33, and the other person will stand on step 22). Vlad cannot have a conversation with the person with height 22 because even if they stand on the extreme steps of the escalator, the height difference between them will be 66, while their height difference is 99. Vlad cannot have a conversation with the rest of the people on the escalator, so the answer for this example is 22."

This is the process of throwing a stone into the sea at a small angle, causing it to fly far and bounce several times off the water surface.Vika has skimmed stones many times and knows that if you throw a stone from the shore perpendicular to the coastline with a force of ff, it will first touch the water at a distance of ff from the shore, then bounce off and touch the water again at a distance of f−1f - 1 from the previous point of contact. The stone will continue to fly in a straight line, reducing the distances between the points where it touches the water, until it falls into the sea.Formally, the points at which the stone touches the water surface will have the following coordinates: ff, f+(f−1)f + (f - 1), f+(f−1)+(f−2)f + (f - 1) + (f - 2), ... , f+(f−1)+(f−2)+…+1f + (f - 1) + (f - 2) + \\ldots + 1 (assuming that 00 is the coordinate of the shoreline).Once, while walking along the embankment of Vladivostok in the evening, Vika saw a group of guys skipping stones across the sea, launching them from the same point with different forces.She became interested in what is the maximum number of guys who can launch a stone with their force fif_i, so that all fif_i are different positive integers, and all nn stones touched the water at the point with the coordinate xx (assuming that 00 is the coordinate of the shoreline).After thinking a little, Vika answered her question.

A tree is a connected graph without loops and multiple edges.This tree is very unusual — it grows with its root upwards. However, it's quite normal for programmer's trees.The apple tree is quite young, so only two apples will grow on it. Apples will grow in certain vertices (these vertices may be the same). After the apples grow, Timofey starts shaking the apple tree until the apples fall. Each time Timofey shakes the apple tree, the following happens to each of the apples:Let the apple now be at vertex uu.  If a vertex uu has a child, the apple moves to it (if there are several such vertices, the apple can move to any of them).  Otherwise, the apple falls from the tree. It can be shown that after a finite time, both apples will fall from the tree.Timofey has qq assumptions in which vertices apples can grow. He assumes that apples can grow in vertices xx and yy, and wants to know the number of pairs of vertices (aa, bb) from which apples can fall from the tree, where aa — the vertex from which an apple from vertex xx will fall, bb — the vertex from which an apple from vertex yy will fall.

After that, he will add children to the vertices in increasing order of their numbers, starting from 22, assigning their children the minimum unused indices. As a result, Vanya will have an infinite tree with the root in the vertex 11, where each vertex will have exactly two children, and the vertex numbers will be arranged sequentially by layers.

In order to successfully complete the mission, he needs to reach the point with coordinates (n,m)(n, m) alive.Let the character of the computer game be located at the coordinate (i,j)(i, j). Every second, starting from the first, Tema can:  either use vertical hyperjump technology, after which his character will end up at coordinate (i+1,j)(i + 1, j) at the end of the second;  or use horizontal hyperjump technology, after which his character will end up at coordinate (i,j+1)(i, j + 1) at the end of the second;  or Tema can choose not to make a hyperjump, in which case his character will not move during this second; The aliens that inhabit this planet are very dangerous and hostile. Therefore, they will shoot from their railguns rr times.Each shot completely penetrates one coordinate vertically or horizontally. If the character is in the line of its impact at the time of the shot (at the end of the second), he dies.Since Tema looked at the game's source code, he knows complete information about each shot — the time, the penetrated coordinate, and the direction of the shot.What is the minimum time for the character to reach the desired point?

Each team is assigned another unique value from 11 to 2k2^k, called a seed, that represents its starting position in the playoff.The tournament consists of 2k−12^k - 1 games. They are held as follows: the teams are split into pairs: team with seed 11 plays against team with seed 22, team with seed 33 plays against team with seed 44 (exactly in this order), and so on (so, 2k−12^{k-1} games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated.After that, only 2k−12^{k-1} teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, 2k−22^{k-2} games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"seed 11 vs seed 22\" plays against the winner of the game \"seed 33 vs seed 44\", then the winner of the game \"seed 55 vs seed 66\" plays against the winner of the game \"seed 77 vs seed 88\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains.After the tournament ends, the teams are assigned places according to the tournament phase when they were eliminated.

If an astrophysicist has bonus equal to xx silver coins, and we denote r=xmodgr = x \\bmod g, then:   If r≥⌈g2⌉r \\geq \\lceil \\frac{g}{2} \\rceil, the astrophysicist receives x+(g−r)x + (g - r) silver coins;  Otherwise, an astrophysicists receives x−rx - r silver coins.  Note that due to rounding, the total sum of actually paid money is not, in general, equal to k⋅gk \\cdot g silver coins. The operation amodba \\bmod b denotes the remainder of the division of aa by bb. Sum of values before rounding has to be equal to k⋅gk \\cdot g silver coins, but some workers can be assigned 00 silver coins.You aim to distribute the bonuses so that the company saves as many silver coins due to rounding as possible. Please note that there is always a distribution in which the company spends no more than k⋅gk \\cdot g silver coins."

The typewriter cells contain nn distinct integers from 11 to nn, and each cell ii initially contains the integer pip_i. Before all actions, the carriage is at cell number 11 and there is nothing in its buffer storage. The cell on which the carriage is located is called the current cell. The carriage can perform five types of operations:  Take the integer from the current cell, if it is not empty, and put it in the carriage buffer, if it is empty (this buffer can contain no more than one integer).  Put the integer from the carriage buffer, if it is not empty, into the current cell, if it is empty.  Swap the number in the carriage buffer with the number in the current cell, if both the buffer and the cell contain integers.  Move the carriage from the current cell ii to cell i+1i + 1 (if i<ni < n), while the integer in the buffer is preserved.

You are given a regular bracket sequence. In one move, you can remove a pair of adjacent brackets such that the left one is an opening bracket and the right one is a closing bracket. Then concatenate the resulting parts without changing the order. The cost of this move is the number of brackets to the right of the right bracket of this pair.The cost of the regular bracket sequence is the smallest total cost of the moves required to make the sequence empty.Actually, you are not removing any brackets. Instead, you are given a regular bracket sequence and an integer kk. You can perform the following operation at most kk times:   extract some bracket from the sequence and insert it back at any position (between any two brackets, at the start or at the end; possibly, at the same place it was before). After all operations are performed, the bracket sequence has to be regular. What is the smallest possible cost of the resulting regular bracket sequence?"

You have studied all existing modern technologies for a long time and are ready to apply all your knowledge in practice. But then you sit down at your desk and see a sheet of paper with the company's motto printed in large letters: abcdabcdabcdabcd....The company's motto contains four main principles— a (Willi), b (Nilli), c (Crack), d (Release). Therefore, you consider strings of length nn consisting of these four Latin letters. Unordered pairs of letters \"ab\", \"bc\", \"cd\", and \"da\" in this motto are adjacent, so we will call such pairs of symbols good. So, if you are given a string ss of length nn, and it is known that the unordered pair of symbols {x,y}\\{ x, y \\} is good, then you can perform one of the following operations on the string:  if sn=xs_n = x, then you are allowed to replace this symbol with yy,  if there exists 1≤i<n1 \\le i < n such that si=xs_i = x and si+1=…=sn=ys_{i+1} = \\ldots = s_n = y, then you are allowed to replace the ii-th symbol of the string with yy, and all subsequent symbols with xx. For example, the string bacdd can be replaced with one of the strings bacda, bacdc, or badcc, and the string aac can be replaced with aab or aad.A non-empty sequence of operations for the string ss will be called correct if the following two conditions are met:  after performing all operations, the string becomes ss again,  no string, except for ss, will occur more than once during the operations. At the same time, the string ss can occur exactly twice - before the start of the operations and after performing all operations. Now we are ready to move on to the problem statement! You have a set of strings that is initially empty. Then, each of qq queries adds another string tit_i to the set, or removes the string tit_i from the set. After each query, you need to output the minimum and maximum size of a correct sequence of operations in which each word occurs at least once. The choice of the initial string ss is up to you."

He does the following:There is a line of length n+1n+1, where the topmost point is position 00 and bottommost is position n+1n+1. The particle is initially (at time t=0t=0) at position 00 and heading downwards. The particle moves at the speed of 11 unit per second. There are nn oscillators at positions 1,2,…,n1,2,\\ldots,n.Each oscillator can be described by a binary string. The initial state of each oscillator is the first character of its binary string. When the particle hits with an oscillator, the particle reverses its direction if its current state is 1\\texttt{1} and continues to move at the same direction if its current state is 0\\texttt{0}, and that oscillator moves on to the next state (the next state of the last state is defined as the first state). Additionally, the particle always reverses its direction when it is at position 00 or n+1n+1 at time t>0t > 0.Bosco would like to know the cycle length of the movement of particle. The cycle length is defined as the minimum value of cc such that for any time t≥0t \\ge 0, the position of the particle at time tt is same as the position of the particle at time t+ct+c. It can be proved that such value cc always exists. As he realises the answer might be too large, he asks you to output your answer modulo 998244353998244353."

Sometimes you need to get a ball with some specific color; but you're too lazy to do it yourself.You have bought two robots to retrieve the balls for you. Now you have to program them. In order to program the robots, you have to construct two lists [a1,a2,…,ak][a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k] and [b1,b2,…,bn−k][b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_{n-k}], where the list aa represents the boxes assigned to the first robot, and the list bb represents the boxes assigned to the second robot. Every integer from 11 to nn must be present in exactly one of these lists.When you request a ball with color xx, the robots work as follows. Each robot looks through the boxes that were assigned to that robot, in the order they appear in the list. The first robot spends s1s_1 seconds analyzing the contents of a box; the second robot spends s2s_2. As soon as one of the robots finds the box with balls of color xx (and analyzes its contents), the search ends. The search time is the number of seconds from the beginning of the search until one of the robots finishes analyzing the contents of the xx-th box. If a robot analyzes the contents of all boxes assigned to it, it stops searching.For example, suppose s1=2s_1 = 2, s2=3s_2 = 3, a=[4,1,5,3,7]a = [4, 1, 5, 3, 7], b=[2,6]b = [2, 6]. If you request a ball with color 33, the following happens:  initially, the first robot starts analyzing the box 44, and the second robot starts analyzing the box 22;  at the end of the 22-nd second, the first robot finishes analyzing the box 44. It is not the box you need, so the robot continues with the box 11;  at the end of the 33-rd second, the second robot finishes analyzing the box 22. It is not the box you need, so the robot continues with the box 66;  at the end of the 44-th second, the first robot finishes analyzing the box 11. It is not the box you need, so the robot continues with the box 55;  at the end of the 66-th second, the first robot finishes analyzing the box 55. It is not the box you need, so the robot continues with the box 33. At the same time, the second robot finishes analyzing the box 66. It is not the box you need, and the second robot has analyzed all the boxes in its list, so that robot stops searching;  at the end of the 88-th second, the first robot finishes analyzing the box 33. It is the box you need, so the search ends;  so, the search time is 88 seconds. You know that you are going to request a ball of color 11 r1r_1 times, a ball of color 22 r2r_2 times, and so on. You want to construct the lists aa and bb for the robots in such a way that the total search time over all requests is the minimum possible."

The matrix consists of concentric ribbons moving clockwise.In other words, the conveyor matrix for n=2n = 2 is simply a matrix 2×22 \\times 2, whose cells form a cycle of length 44 clockwise. For any natural k≥2k \\ge 2, the matrix m2km_{2k} is obtained by adding to the matrix m2k−2m_{2k - 2} an outer layer forming a clockwise cycle.    The conveyor matrix 8×88 \\times 8.   You are standing in a cell with coordinates x1,y1x_1, y_1 and you want to get into a cell with coordinates x2,y2x_2, y_2. A cell has coordinates x,yx, y if it is located at the intersection of the xxth row and the yyth column.Standing on some cell, every second you will move to the cell next in the direction of movement of the tape on which you are. You can also move to a neighboring cell by spending one unit of energy. Movements happen instantly and you can make an unlimited number of them at any time.Your task is to find the minimum amount of energy that will have to be spent to get from the cell with coordinates x1,y1x_1, y_1 to the cell with coordinates x2,y2x_2, y_2.For example, n=8n=8 initially you are in a cell with coordinates 1,31,3 and you want to get into a cell with coordinates 6,46, 4. You can immediately make 22 movements, once you are in a cell with coordinates 3,33, 3, and then after 88 seconds you will be in the right cell."

The value of a good tree is the maximum value of all its leaves.Now, you are given an array of nn integers a1,a2,…,ana_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}, which are the integers that should be written on the leaves. You need to construct a good tree with nn leaves and write the integers from the array aa to all the leaves. Formally, you should assign each leaf uu an index bub_{u}, where bb is a permutation of length nn, and represent that the integer written on leaf uu is cu=abuc_u = a_{b_{u}}. Under these constraints, you need to minimize the value of the good tree.You have qq queries.

A permutation of length nn is an array consisting of nn distinct integers from 11 to nn in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4][2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2][1,2,2] is not a permutation (22 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4][1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3n=3 but there is 44 in the array)."

The ball is going down and left, denoted by DL\\texttt{DL}; it means that after a step, the ball's location goes from (i,j)(i, j) to (i+1,j−1)(i+1, j-1).

After each step, the ball maintains its direction unless it hits a wall (that is, the direction takes it out of the room's bounds in the next step). In this case, the ball's direction gets flipped along the axis of the wall; if the ball hits a corner, both directions get flipped. Any instance of this is called a bounce. The ball never stops moving.  In the above example, the ball starts at (1,7)(1, 7) and goes DL\\texttt{DL} until it reaches the bottom wall, then it bounces and continues in the direction UL\\texttt{UL}. After reaching the left wall, the ball bounces and continues to go in the direction UR\\texttt{UR}. When the ball reaches the upper wall, it bounces and continues in the direction DR\\texttt{DR}. After reaching the bottom-right corner, it bounces once and continues in direction UL\\texttt{UL}, and so on.Your task is to find how many bounces the ball will go through until it reaches cell (i2,j2)(i_2, j_2) in the room, or report that it never reaches cell (i2,j2)(i_2, j_2) by printing −1-1.Note that the ball first goes in a cell and only after that bounces if it needs to."

The graph can contain self-loops, i. e. edges connecting a node to itself.The distance between vertices uu and vv is denoted as ρ(u,v)\\rho(u, v) and equals the minimum possible number of edges on a path between uu and vv. The diameter of graph GG is defined as the maximum possible distance between some pair of its vertices. We denote it as d(G)d(G). In other words, d(G)=max1≤u,v≤nρ(u,v).d(G) = \\max_{1 \\le u, v \\le n}{\\rho(u, v)}.Jack plans to consecutively apply qq updates to his graph. Each update adds exactly one edge to the graph. Denote as GiG_i the graph after exactly ii updates are made. Jack wants to calculate q+1q + 1 values d(G0),d(G1),d(G2),…,d(Gq)d(G_0), d(G_1), d(G_2), \\ldots, d(G_q).However, Jack suspects that finding the exact diameters of q+1q + 1 graphs might be a difficult task, so he is fine with approximate answers that differ from the correct answers no more than twice. Formally, Jack wants to find a sequence of positive integers a0,a1,a2,…,aqa_0, a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_q such that ⌈d(Gi)2⌉≤ai≤2⋅d(Gi)\\left\\lceil \\frac{d(G_i)}{2} \\right\\rceil \\le a_i \\le 2 \\cdot d(G_i) for each ii.HacksYou cannot make hacks in this problem."

    "description": "Ada operates a network that consists of nn servers and mm direct connections between them. Each direct connection between a pair of distinct servers allows bidirectional transmission of information between these two servers. Ada knows that these mm direct connections allow to directly or indirectly transmit information between any two servers in this network. We say that server vv is a neighbor of server uu if there exists a direct connection between these two servers.Ada needs to configure her network's WRP (Weird Routing Protocol). For each server uu she needs to select exactly one of its neighbors as an auxiliary server a(u)a(u). After all a(u)a(u) are set, routing works as follows. Suppose server uu wants to find a path to server vv (different from uu).   Server uu checks all of its direct connections to other servers. If it sees a direct connection with server vv, it knows the path and the process terminates.  If the path was not found at the first step, server uu asks its auxiliary server a(u)a(u) to find the path.  Auxiliary server a(u)a(u) follows this process starting from the first step.  After a(u)a(u) finds the path, it returns it to uu. Then server uu constructs the resulting path as the direct connection between uu and a(u)a(u) plus the path from a(u)a(u) to vv. As you can see, this procedure either produces a correct path and finishes or keeps running forever. Thus, it is critically important for Ada to configure her network's WRP properly.Your goal is to assign an auxiliary server a(u)a(u) for each server uu in the given network. Your assignment should make it possible to construct a path from any server uu to any other server vv using the aforementioned procedure. Or you should report that such an assignment doesn't exist."

The roulette's wheel consists of nn sectors number from 00 to n−1n - 1. There is no ball and the winning sector is determined by a static arrow pointing to one of the sectors. Sectors' indexes go in the natural order and the wheel always spins in the direction of indexes increment. That means that sector i+1i + 1 goes right after sector ii for all ii from 00 to n−2n - 2, and sector 00 goes right after sector n−1n - 1.After a bet is made, the player is allowed to pull the triggering handle herself and cause the wheel to spin. If the player's initial pull is made with the force equal to positive integer ff, the wheel will spin for ff seconds. During the first second it will advance ff sectors, the next second it will advance f−1f - 1 sectors, then f−2f - 2 sectors, and so on until it comes to a complete stop. After the wheel comes to a complete stop, the sector which the arrow is pointing to is the winning one.The roulette's arrow currently points at sector xx. Vesper knows that she can pull the handle with any integer force from 11 to pp inclusive. Note that it is not allowed to pull the handle with force 00, i. e. not pull it all.

For the convenience of representing the country, for each city ii, the city pip_i is fixed, equal to the first city to which you need to go from the city ii to get to the city 11. In other words, the city pip_i is equal to the ancestor of the city ii if the tree is hung for the city 11.There is one gas station in each city of Berland. Gas stations have special pricing, and for each gas station there is a fixed range of prices for which they are ready to sell gasoline. A gas station in the city with the number ii is ready to sell gasoline at any price from lil_i to rir_i inclusive.The King of Berland — is an exemplary family man, and for mm years, two sons were born to him every year. The king's children have been involved in public affairs since early childhood, and at the end of each year they check the honesty of gasoline prices.

The first son of the king, born in the year ii, moves along the path from the city aia_i to the city bib_i, and the second  — from the city cic_i to the city did_i. Children check that the price of gasoline in the city of aia_i coincides with the price of gasoline in the city of cic_i. Next, they check that the price of gasoline in the second city on the way from aia_i to bib_i coincides with the price in the second city on the way from cic_i to did_i. Then they repeat the same thing for a couple of third cities on their paths and so on. At the end, they check that the price of gasoline in the city of bib_i coincides with the price of gasoline in the city of did_i. It is guaranteed that the length of the path from the city aia_i to the city bib_i coincides with the length of the path from the city cic_i to the city did_i.Gas stations must strictly obey the laws, and therefore all checks of gasoline prices should not reveal violations.

In other words, for each ii from 11 to mm, calculate how many ways you can set gasoline prices at all gas stations so that after the birth of the first ii pairs of the king's children, all their checks did not reveal violations, and at any gas station the price was in the acceptable price range. Since the number of such methods can be large, calculate the answer modulo 109+710^9 + 7. "

Your goal is to kill all the remaining monsters with those \"chaining\" explosions, that's why you need a basic spell to decrease hih_i of some monsters or even kill them beforehand (monsters die when their current health hih_i becomes less or equal to zero). Note that monsters don't move between cells, so, for example, monsters ii and i+2i + 2 will never become neighbors.What is the minimum total MP you need to kill all monsters in the way you want?

Bonuses do not move during the game.There can be several tokens in one vertex at the same time, but initially there is no more than one token in each vertex.The vertex with number 11 is the finish vertex, and your task is to determine whether it is possible to hit it with any token by making turns with the tiles according to the rules described above.

For example:  [3,6][3,6] is not good, because gcd(3,6)=3\\gcd(3,6)=3 is greater than its length 22.  [1,2,4][1,2,4] is both good and beautiful, because all of its prefixes whose length is no less than 22, which are [1,2][1,2] and [1,2,4][1,2,4], are both good.  [3,6,1][3,6,1] is good but not beautiful, because [3,6][3,6] is not good. Now Mocha gives you the gift array aa of nn positive integers, and she wants to know whether array aa could become beautiful by reordering the elements in aa.

For that purpose, they built a village to lodge its participants.The village has the shape of an equilateral triangle delimited by three roads of length nn. It is cut into n2n^2 smaller equilateral triangles, of side length 11, by 3n−33n-3 additional roads which run parallel to the sides. See the figure for n=3n=3. Each of the 3n3n roads is made of multiple (possibly 11) road segments of length 11 which connect adjacent intersections.    The direction has already been chosen for each of the 3n3n roads (so, for each road, the same direction is assigned to all its road segments). Traffic can only go in the specified directions (i. e. the roads are monodirectional).You are tasked with making adjustments to the traffic plan so that from each intersection it is possible to reach every other intersection. Specifically, you can invert the traffic direction of any number of road segments of length 11. What is the minimal number of road segments for which you need to invert the traffic direction?"

Therefore, he retired and decided to become a xorcerer.One day, while taking a walk in a park, Misha came across a rooted tree with nodes numbered from 11 to nn. The root of the tree is node 11. For each 1≤i≤n1\\le i\\le n, node ii contains aia_i stones in it. Misha has recently learned a new spell in his xorcery class and wants to test it out. A spell consists of:  Choose some node ii (1≤i≤n1 \\leq i \\leq n).  Calculate the bitwise XOR xx of all aja_j such that node jj is in the subtree of ii (ii belongs to its own subtree).  Set aja_j equal to xx for all nodes jj in the subtree of ii. Misha can perform at most 2n2n spells and he wants to remove all stones from the tree. More formally, he wants ai=0a_i=0 to hold for each 1≤i≤n1\\leq i \\leq n. Can you help him perform the spells?A tree with nn nodes is a connected acyclic graph which contains n−1n-1 edges. The subtree of node ii is the set of all nodes jj such that ii lies on the simple path from 11 (the root) to jj. We consider ii to be contained in its own subtree."

Anya does not know, for each pair, who is the player who beats the other.To organize a tournament, Anya hosts n−1n-1 games. In each game, she chooses two players. One of them wins and stays, while the other one is disqualified. After all the games are hosted only one player will remain. A player is said to be a candidate master if they can win a tournament (notice that the winner of a tournament may depend on the players selected by Anya in the n−1n-1 games).Since Anya is a curious girl, she is interested in finding the candidate masters. Unfortunately, she does not have much time. To speed up the process, she will organize up to 2n2n simuls (short for \"simultaneous exhibition\", in which one player plays against many).In one simul, Anya chooses exactly one player who will play against some (at least one) of the other players. The chosen player wins all games they would win in a regular game, and the same holds for losses. After the simul finishes, Anya is only told the total number of games won by the chosen player (but not which ones). Nobody is disqualified during a simul.Can you help Anya host simuls and determine the candidate masters?The winning players in each pair could be changed between the simuls, but only in a way that preserves the results of all previous simuls. These changes may depend on your queries."

In this way, after each of the first n−3n - 3 turns the pizza will have one less vertex. The game ends after the (n−2)(n - 2)-th turn, when all the pizza has been eaten.Assuming that Alberto and Beatrice choose the slices to eat optimally, which of the siblings manages to eat at most half of the pizza? You should identify a sibling that has a strategy to do so and help them choose the slices appropriately. Note that it is possible that both Alberto and Beatrice end up eating exactly half of the area if they choose their slices optimally."

There will be 2n−12n - 1 bottles of wine arranged in a row, each of which is either red wine or white wine.This time, Gabriella has already chosen the type and order of all the bottles. The types of the wines are represented by a string ss of length 2n−12n - 1. For each 1≤i≤2n−11 \\le i \\le 2n - 1, it holds that si=Rs_i = \\texttt{R} if the ii-th bottle is red wine, and si=Ws_i = \\texttt{W} if the ii-th bottle is white wine.Exactly nn critics have been invited to attend. The critics are numbered from 11 to nn. Just like last year, each critic jj wants to taste an interval of wines, that is, the bottles at positions aj,aj+1,…,bja_j, \\, a_j + 1, \\, \\dots, \\, b_j for some 1≤aj≤bj≤2n−11 \\le a_j \\le b_j \\le 2n - 1. Moreover, they have the following additional requirements:  each of them wants to taste at least nn wines, that is, it must hold that bj−aj+1≥nb_j - a_j + 1 \\ge n;  no two critics must taste exactly the same wines, that is, if j≠kj \\ne k it must hold that aj≠aka_j \\ne a_k or bj≠bkb_j \\ne b_k. Gabriella knows that, since the event is held in a coastal region of Italy, critics are especially interested in the white wines, and don't care much about the red ones. (Indeed, white wine is perfect to accompany seafood.) Thus, to ensure fairness, she would like that all critics taste the same number of white wines.Help Gabriella find an integer xx (with 0≤x≤2n−10 \\le x \\le 2n - 1) such that there exists a valid assignment of intervals to critics where each critic tastes exactly xx white wines. It can be proved that at least one such xx always exists."

The government does not want to give too much power to a single company, but it also does not want to make people buy a lot of different subscriptions. Also, it would like to give a fair chance to all companies. In order to formalize all these wishes, the following model was proposed.There will be k≥2k \\ge 2 private companies indexed by 1,2,…,k1, \\, 2, \\, \\dots, \\, k. Each train route will be operated by exactly one of the kk companies. Then:  For any company, there should exist two cities such that it is impossible to reach one from the other using only routes operated by that company.  On the other hand, for any two companies, it should be possible to reach every city from any other city using only routes operated by these two companies. Find a plan satisfying all these criteria.

Each railway is identified with an integer from 11 to mm, railway 11 being the closest to the first platform and railway mm being the farthest. There is a 11 meter distance between consecutive railways, as well as between each platform and its closest railway.Isona is standing on the inner border of the first platform, when she realizes that she forgot to validate her ticket! There is a validating machine on the second platform, exactly opposite her current position (thus, the distance between Isona and the validating machine is m+1m + 1 meters). There are only ss seconds left to validate the ticket and the bridge designated to cross the railways is too far from the validating machine. Therefore, Isona (who is very brave and a little bit careless) will cross the railways running in a straight line perpendicular to the railways themselves. Isona can only run forward (not backward) and she can stay still. When she runs at maximum speed, she needs vv seconds to traverse 11 meter. She can run at any speed less than or equal to her maximum speed.There is only one problem: nn trains are programmed to transit through the railways. The ii-th train will use the railway rir_i. It will start crossing the straight line between Isona and the validating machine aia_i seconds from now and it will end bib_i seconds from now. Of course, Isona cannot cross a railway when a train is passing. Formally, for every i=1,2,…,ni = 1, \\, 2, \\, \\dots, \\, n, Isona is not allowed to be on railway rir_i at any time tt with ai<t<bia_i < t < b_i (but she is allowed to cross at times aia_i or bib_i).The following picture summarizes the situation. In the picture there are m=4m = 4 railways and two trains are visible; the train going through railway 33 is currently crossing the line between Isona and the validating machine.  Isona is a really good runner, but she gets tired every time she has to change her running speed. What is the minimum number of speed changes she has to perform to get to the validating machine on the other platform within ss seconds from now? Note that at the beginning Isona is not running. She can start to run anytime. The instant she starts to run (i.e. her speed becomes positive) is not counted as a speed change."

They can be arranged in the 3D space to build structures, provided that the following rules are met: No two bricks can intersect, but they can touch on their faces. The corners of every brick must have integer coordinates (so bricks are axis-aligned) and the zz coordinates of all corners must be non-negative. The square bases of every brick must be parallel to the ground (i.e. the plane z=0z=0).

    "description": "As you know, Martian scientists are actively engaged in space research. One of the highest priorities is Pluto. In order to study this planet in more detail, it was decided to build a laboratory on Pluto.It is known that the lab will be built of nn square blocks of equal size. For convenience, we will assume that Pluto's surface is a plane divided by vertical and horizontal lines into unit squares. Each square is either occupied by a lab block or not, and only nn squares are occupied.Since each block is square, it has four walls. If a wall is adjacent to another block, it is considered inside, otherwise — outside.Pluto is famous for its extremely cold temperatures, so the outside walls of the lab must be insulated. One unit of insulation per exterior wall would be required. Thus, the greater the total length of the outside walls of the lab (i. e., its perimeter), the more insulation will be needed.Consider the lab layout in the figure below. It shows that the lab consists of n=33n = 33 blocks, and all the blocks have a total of 2424 outside walls, i. e. 2424 units of insulation will be needed.You should build the lab optimally, i. e., minimize the amount of insulation. On the other hand, there may be many optimal options, so scientists may be interested in the number of ways to build the lab using the minimum amount of insulation, modulo a prime number mm.Two ways are considered the same if they are the same when overlapping without turning. Thus, if a lab plan is rotated by 90∘90^{\\circ}, such a new plan can be considered a separate way.To help scientists explore Pluto, you need to write a program that solves these difficult problems.

You choose some subsequence†^\\dagger. Then you call all the numbers at odd positions in this subsequence northern, and all the numbers at even positions in this subsequence southern. In this case, only the position of the number in the subsequence is taken into account, not in the original sequence.For example, consider the sequence 1,4,2,8,5,7,3,6,91, 4, 2, 8, 5, 7, 3, 6, 9 and its subsequence (shown in bold) 1,4,2,8,5,7,3,6,91, \\mathbf{4}, \\mathbf{2}, 8, \\mathbf{5}, 7, 3, \\mathbf{6}, 9. Then the numbers 44 and 55 are northern, and the numbers 22 and 66 are southern.After that, you can do one of the following:   add 11 to all northern numbers and subtract 11 from all south numbers; or  add 11 to all southern numbers and subtract 11 from all northern numbers. Thus, from the sequence 1,4,2,8,5,7,3,6,91, \\mathbf{4}, \\mathbf{2}, 8, \\mathbf{5}, 7, 3, \\mathbf{6}, 9, if you choose the subsequence shown in bold, you can get either 1,5,1,8,6,7,3,5,91, \\mathbf{5}, \\mathbf{1}, 8, \\mathbf{6}, 7, 3, \\mathbf{5}, 9 or 1,3,3,8,4,7,3,7,91, \\mathbf{3}, \\mathbf{3}, 8, \\mathbf{4}, 7, 3, \\mathbf{7}, 9.Then the operation ends. Note also that all operations are independent, i. e. the numbers are no longer called northern or southern when one operation ends.It is necessary to turn all the numbers of the sequence into zeros using the operations described above. Since there is very little time left before the costume contest, the friends want to know, what is the minimum number of operations required for this.The friends were unable to solve this problem, so can you help them?†^\\dagger A sequence cc is a subsequence of a sequence dd if cc can be obtained from dd by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements."

Namely, the ii-th and jj-th spiders are friends if gcd(ai,aj)≠1\\gcd(a_i, a_j) \\ne 1, i. e., there is some integer k≥2k \\ge 2 such that aia_i and aja_j are simultaneously divided by kk without a remainder. Here gcd(x,y)\\gcd(x, y) denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers xx and yy.Scientists have discovered that spiders can send messages. If two spiders are friends, then they can transmit a message directly in one second. Otherwise, the spider must pass the message to his friend, who in turn must pass the message to his friend, and so on until the message reaches the recipient.Let's look at an example.Suppose a spider with eight legs wants to send a message to a spider with 1515 legs. He can't do it directly, because gcd(8,15)=1\\gcd(8, 15) = 1. But he can send a message through the spider with six legs because gcd(8,6)=2\\gcd(8, 6) = 2 and gcd(6,15)=3\\gcd(6, 15) = 3. Thus, the message will arrive in two seconds.Right now, scientists are observing how the ss-th spider wants to send a message to the tt-th spider. The researchers have a hypothesis that spiders always transmit messages optimally. For this reason, scientists would need a program that could calculate the minimum time to send a message and also deduce one of the optimal routes.  "

Moreover, due to the inexplicable love of the CEO of BinCoin for all the binary stuff, the subordination structure in the company is a binary rooted tree. That means each employee is directly superior to exactly zero or two other employees.In the CEO's opinion, working in this company is almost as dangerous as in mines. So, employees should sign the waiver of claims sometimes. This process happens in the following way. Initially, CEO takes the journal, then recursively the following procedure is performed:  If an employee that holds the journal does not have any subordinates, they sign the waiver in the journal and give it back to their superior. The procedure stops if that was the CEO, who has no superior.  Otherwise   they choose one of two of their direct subordinates uniformly at random and give the journal to one of them;  when they get the journal back, they sign it;  and then they give it to another direct subordinate;  when they get it back again, they give it back to their superior.

There are also kk butterflies on the tree. Initially, the ii-th butterfly is on vertex aia_i. All values of aa are pairwise distinct.Koxia plays a game as follows:  For i=1,2,…,n−1i = 1, 2, \\dots, n - 1, Koxia set the direction of the ii-th edge as ui→viu_i \\rightarrow v_i or vi→uiv_i \\rightarrow u_i with equal probability.  For i=1,2,…,n−1i = 1, 2, \\dots, n - 1, if a butterfly is on the initial vertex of ii-th edge and there is no butterfly on the terminal vertex, then this butterfly flies to the terminal vertex.

Koxia chooses two butterflies from the kk butterflies with equal probability from all possible k(k−1)2\\frac{k(k-1)}{2} ways to select two butterflies, then she takes the distance†^\\dagger between the two chosen vertices as her score.

Monocarp has spent days analyzing the in-game economy; he came to the following conclusion: it is possible to sell one gold coin for aa silver coins (i. e. Monocarp can lose one gold coin to gain aa silver coins), or buy one gold coin for bb silver coins (i. e. Monocarp can lose bb silver coins to gain one gold coin).Now Monocarp wants to calculate the minimum number of quests that he has to complete in order to have at least nn silver coins after some abuse of the in-game economy. Note that Monocarp can perform exchanges of both types (selling and buying gold coins for silver coins) any number of times."

All videos are published on the Internet. A video should be downloaded before it can be watched. Monocarp has poor Internet connection — it takes exactly 11 minute to download 11 megabyte of data, so it will require aia_i minutes to download the ii-th video.Monocarp's computer has a hard disk of mm megabytes. The disk is used to store the downloaded videos. Once Monocarp starts the download of a video of size ss, the ss megabytes are immediately reserved on a hard disk. If there are less than ss megabytes left, the download cannot be started until the required space is freed. Each single video can be stored on the hard disk, since ai≤ma_i \\le m for all ii. Once the download is started, it cannot be interrupted. It is not allowed to run two or more downloads in parallel.Once a video is fully downloaded to the hard disk, Monocarp can watch it. Watching each video takes exactly 11 minute and does not occupy the Internet connection, so Monocarp can start downloading another video while watching the current one.When Monocarp finishes watching a video, he doesn't need it on the hard disk anymore, so he can delete the video, instantly freeing the space it occupied on a hard disk. Deleting a video takes negligible time.Monocarp wants to watch all nn videos as quickly as possible. The order of watching does not matter, since Monocarp needs to watch all of them anyway. Please calculate the minimum possible time required for that."

Let cic_i be the ii-th card of the deck (from top to bottom).Monocarp starts drawing the cards from the deck one by one. Before drawing a card, he tries to guess its suit. Monocarp remembers the suits of the kk last cards, and his guess is the suit that appeared the least often among the last kk cards he has drawn. So, while drawing the ii-th card, Monocarp guesses that its suit is the suit that appears the minimum number of times among the cards ci−k,ci−k+1,…,ci−1c_{i-k}, c_{i-k+1}, \\dots, c_{i-1} (if i≤ki \\le k, Monocarp considers all previously drawn cards, that is, the cards c1,c2,…,ci−1c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_{i-1}). If there are multiple suits that appeared the minimum number of times among the previous cards Monocarp remembers, he chooses a random suit out of those for his guess (all suits that appeared the minimum number of times have the same probability of being chosen).After making a guess, Monocarp draws a card and compares its suit to his guess. If they match, then his guess was correct; otherwise it was incorrect.Your task is to calculate the expected number of correct guesses Monocarp makes after drawing all 4n4n cards from the deck."

Note that the number of times a key was pressed is counted for the whole keyboard, not for each key separately. For example, if Mishka tries to type the word osu, it will be printed on the screen as ossu.You are given a word consisting of nn lowercase Latin letters. You have to determine if it can be printed on Mishka's keyboard or not.

The puzzle consists of an n×mn \\times m grid of clocks, and each clock always displays some hour exactly (that is, it doesn't lie between two hours). In one move, he can choose any row or column and shift all clocks in that row or column one hour forward†^\\dagger.The grid of clocks is called solvable if it is possible to make all the clocks display the same time.While building his puzzle, Tannhaus suddenly got worried that it might not be possible to make the grid solvable. Some cells of the grid have clocks already displaying a certain initial time, while the rest of the cells are empty.Given the partially completed grid of clocks, find the number of ways‡^\\ddagger to assign clocks in the empty cells so that the grid is solvable. The answer can be enormous, so compute it modulo 109+710^9 + 7.†^\\dagger If a clock currently displays hour tt and is shifted one hour forward, then the clock will instead display hour (t+1)modh(t+1) \\bmod h.‡^\\ddagger Two assignments are different if there exists some cell with a clock that displays a different time in both arrangements."

Initially, there are cacti in some cells of the field. Note that, in Minecraft, cacti cannot grow on cells adjacent to each other by side — and the initial field meets this restriction. Monocarp can plant new cacti (they must also fulfil the aforementioned condition). He can't chop down any of the cacti that are already growing on the field — he doesn't have an axe, and the cacti are too prickly for his hands.Monocarp believes that the wall is complete if there is no path from the top row of the field to the bottom row, such that:   each two consecutive cells in the path are adjacent by side;  no cell belonging to the path contains a cactus. Your task is to plant the minimum number of cacti to build a wall (or to report that this is impossible)."

For example, let a=[42,314]a = [42, 314]:  [1,1][1, 1] is a removal sequence: when you remove the 11-st element of the array, the condition gcd(42,1)=1gcd(42, 1) = 1 holds, and the array becomes [314][314]; when you remove the 11-st element again, the condition gcd(314,1)=1gcd(314, 1) = 1 holds, and the array becomes empty.  [2,1][2, 1] is not a removal sequence: when you try to remove the 22-nd element, the condition gcd(314,2)=1gcd(314, 2) = 1 is false. An array is ambiguous if it has at least two removal sequences.

The ii-th monster has aia_i health and a special \"Death's Blessing\" spell of strength bib_i attached to it.You are going to kill all of them one by one. It takes exactly hh seconds to kill a monster with health hh.When the ii-th monster dies, it casts its spell that increases the health of its neighbors by bib_i (the neighbors of the jj-th monster in the row are the monsters on places j−1j - 1 and j+1j + 1. The first and the last monsters have only one neighbor each).After each monster is killed, the row shrinks, so its former neighbors become adjacent to each other (so if one of them dies, the other one is affected by its spell). For example, imagine a situation with 44 monsters with health a=[2,6,7,3]a = [2, 6, 7, 3] and spells b=[3,6,0,5]b = [3, 6, 0, 5].

It is known that the traffic light repeats its colors every nn seconds and at the ii-th second the color sis_i is on.That way, the order of the colors is described by a string. For example, if s=s=\"rggry\", then the traffic light works as the following: red-green-green-red-yellow-red-green-green-red-yellow- ... and so on.More formally, you are given a string s1,s2,…,sns_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n of length nn. At the first second the color s1s_1 is on, at the second — s2s_2, ..., at the nn-th second the color sns_n is on, at the n+1n + 1-st second the color s1s_1 is on and so on.You need to cross the road and that can only be done when the green color is on. You know which color is on the traffic light at the moment, but you don't know the current moment of time. You need to find the minimum amount of time in which you are guaranteed to cross the road.You can assume that you cross the road immediately. For example, with s=s=\"rggry\" and the current color r there are two options: either the green color will be on after 11 second, or after 33.

That is, for every ii (1≤i≤n1 \\le i \\le n), pi≠ip_i \\neq i must be satisfied. Let's call the permutation that satisfies these requirements funny.For example, let n=4n = 4. Then [4,3,1,24, 3, 1, 2] is a funny permutation, since:   to the right of p1=4p_1=4 is p2=p1−1=4−1=3p_2=p_1-1=4-1=3;  to the left of p2=3p_2=3 is p1=p2+1=3+1=4p_1=p_2+1=3+1=4;  to the right of p3=1p_3=1 is p4=p3+1=1+1=2p_4=p_3+1=1+1=2;  to the left of p4=2p_4=2 is p3=p4−1=2−1=1p_3=p_4-1=2-1=1.  for all ii is pi≠ip_i \\ne i. For a given positive integer nn, output any funny permutation of length nn, or output -1 if funny permutation of length nn does not exist."

Boris has only one card left, which is 11; he plays it, and Alex responds with the card 33. So, the game ends in a draw;  if Alex plays the card 33, then Boris has to respond with the card 44.

Therefore, she decided to take a dancing class.There are nn students in the dancing class, including Ela. In the final project, nn students will participate in a choreography described below.nn students are positioned on the positive side of the OxOx-axis. The ii-th dancer is located at ai>0a_i > 0. Some dancers will change positions during the dance (we'll call them movable dancers), and others will stay in the same place during a choreography (we'll call them immovable dancers). We distinguish the dancers using a binary string ss of length nn: if sis_i equals '1', then the ii-th dancer is movable, otherwise the ii-th dancer is immovable.Let's call the \"positive energy value\" of the choreography d>0d > 0. The dancers will perform \"movements\" based on this value.Each minute after the dance begins, the movable dancer with the smallest xx-coordinate will start moving to the right and initiate a \"movement\". At the beginning of the movement, the dancer's energy level will be initiated equally to the positive energy value of the choreography, which is dd. Each time they move from some yy to y+1y+1, the energy level will be decreased by 11. At some point, the dancer might meet other fellow dancers in the same coordinates. If it happens, then the energy level of the dancer will be increased by 11. A dancer will stop moving to the right when his energy level reaches 00, and he doesn't share a position with another dancer.The dancers are very well-trained, and each \"movement\" will end before the next minute begins.To show her understanding of this choreography, Ela has to answer qq queries, each consisting of two integers kk and mm. The answer to this query is the coordinate of the mm-th dancer of both types from the left at kk-th minute after the choreography begins.

    "description": "Ela likes to go hiking a lot. She loves nature and exploring the various creatures it offers. One day, she saw a strange type of ant, with a cannibalistic feature. More specifically, an ant would eat any ants that it sees which is smaller than it.Curious about this feature from a new creature, Ela ain't furious. She conducts a long, non-dubious, sentimental experiment.She puts nn cannibalistic ants in a line on a long wooden stick. Initially, the ants have the same weight of 11. The distance between any two consecutive ants is the same. The distance between the first ant in the line to the left end and the last ant in the line to the right end is also the same as the distance between the ants. Each ant starts moving towards the left-end or the right-end randomly and equiprobably, at the same constant pace throughout the experiment. Two ants will crash if they are standing next to each other in the line and moving in opposite directions, and ants will change direction immediately when they reach the end of the stick. Ela can't determine the moving direction of each ant, but she understands very well their behavior when crashes happen.  If a crash happens between two ants of different weights, the heavier one will eat the lighter one, and gain the weight of the lighter one. After that, the heavier and will continue walking in the same direction. In other words, if the heavier one has weight xx and walking to the right, the lighter one has weight yy and walking to the left (x>yx > y), then after the crash, the lighter one will diminish, and the heavier one will have weight x+yx + y and continue walking to the right.  If a crash happens between two ants with the same weight, the one walking to the left end of the stick will eat the one walking to the right, and then continue walking in the same direction. In other words, if one ant of weight xx walking to the left, crashes with another ant of weight xx walking to the right, the one walking to the right will disappear, and the one walking to the left will have to weight 2x2x and continue walking to the left. Please, check the example in the \"Note\" section, which will demonstrate the ants' behavior as above.We can prove that after a definite amount of time, there will be only one last ant standing. Initially, each ant can randomly and equiprobably move to the left or the right, which generates 2n2^n different cases of initial movements for the whole pack. For each position in the line, calculate the probability that the ant begins in that position and survives. Output it modulo 109+710^9 + 7.Formally, let M=109+7M = 10^9 + 7. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction pq\\frac{p}{q}, where pp and qq are integers and q≢q \\not \\equiv 0 \\pmod{M}. Output the integer equal to p \\cdot q^{-1} \\bmod Mp \\cdot q^{-1} \\bmod M.

Currently, with the network condition, she complains that the network is too slow and the package can't arrive in time. Luckily, a Wiring Wizard offered her a helping hand.The network can be represented as an undirected connected graph with nn nodes, each node representing a machine. mm wires are used to connect them. Wire ii is used to connect machines uiu_i and viv_i, and has a weight wiw_i. The aforementioned large package, if going through wire ii, will move from machine uiu_i to machine viv_i (or vice versa) in exactly wiw_i microseconds. The Wiring Wizard can use his spell an arbitrary number of times. For each spell, he will choose the wire of index ii, connecting machine uiu_i and viv_i, and rewire it following these steps:  Choose one machine that is connected by this wire. Without loss of generality, let's choose viv_i.  Choose a machine that is currently connecting to viv_i (including uiu_i), call it tit_i. Disconnect the wire indexed ii from viv_i, then using it to connect uiu_i and tit_i. The rewiring of wire ii will takes wiw_i microseconds, and the weight of the wire will not change after this operation. After a rewiring, a machine might have some wire connect it with itself. Also, the Wiring Wizard has warned Ela that rewiring might cause temporary disconnections between some machines, but Ela just ignores it anyway. Her mission is to send the large package from machine 11 to machine nn as fast as possible. Note that the Wizard can use his spell on a wire zero, one, or many times. To make sure the network works seamlessly while transferring the large package, once the package starts transferring from machine 11, the Wiring Wizard cannot use his spell to move wires around anymore.Ela wonders, with the help of the Wiring Wizard, what is the least amount of time needed to transfer the large package from machine 11 to nn."

Three cards are called a set if all kk features are good for them.For example, the cards (0,0,0)(0, 0, 0), (0,2,1)(0, 2, 1), and (0,1,2)(0, 1, 2) form a set, but the cards (0,2,2)(0, 2, 2), (2,1,2)(2, 1, 2), and (1,2,0)(1, 2, 0) do not, as, for example, the last feature is not good.A group of five cards is called a meta-set, if there is strictly more than one set among them. How many meta-sets there are among given nn distinct cards?"

Let bib_i be the value which the ii-th fisherman in the order will tell to the other fishermen.

If b=1b = 1, it means the happiness of the person will increase if he tells the story to someone strictly more happy than them.Let us define a speaking order as an ordering of the people from left to right. Now the following process occurs. We go from left to right. The current person tells the story to all people other than himself. Note that all happiness values stay constant while this happens. After the person is done, he counts the number of people who currently have strictly less/more happiness than him as per his kind of personality, and his happiness increases by that value. Note that only the current person's happiness value increases.As the organizer of the party, you don't want anyone to leave sad. Therefore, you want to count the number of speaking orders such that at the end of the process all nn people have equal happiness.Two speaking orders are considered different if there exists at least one person who does not have the same position in the two speaking orders."

Codeforces strongly condemns this action and therefore further submissions to this problem are not accepted.Debajyoti has a very important meeting to attend and he is already very late. Harsh, his driver, needs to take Debajyoti to the destination for the meeting as fast as possible.Harsh needs to pick up Debajyoti from his home and take him to the destination so that Debajyoti can attend the meeting in time. A straight road with nn traffic lights connects the home and the destination for the interview. The traffic lights are numbered in order from 11 to nn.Each traffic light cycles after tt seconds. The ii-th traffic light is green\\color{green}{\\text{green}} (in which case Harsh can cross the traffic light) for the first gig_i seconds, and red\\color{red}{\\text{red}} (in which case Harsh must wait for the light to turn green\\color{green}{\\text{green}}) for the remaining (t−gi)(t−g_i) seconds, after which the pattern repeats. Each light's cycle repeats indefinitely and initially, the ii-th light is cic_i seconds into its cycle (a light with ci=0c_i=0 has just turned green\\color{green}{\\text{green}}). In the case that Harsh arrives at a light at the same time it changes colour, he will obey the new colour. Formally, the ii-th traffic light is green\\color{green}{\\text{green}} from [0,gi)[0,g_i) and red\\color{red}{\\text{red}} from [gi,t)[g_i,t) (after which it repeats the cycle). The ii-th traffic light is initially at the cic_i-th second of its cycle.From the ii-th traffic light, exactly did_i seconds are required to travel to the next traffic light (that is to the (i+1)(i+1)-th light). Debajyoti's home is located just before the first light and Debajyoti drops for the interview as soon as he passes the nn-th light. In other words, no time is required to reach the first light from Debajyoti's home or to reach the interview centre from the nn-th light.Harsh does not know how much longer it will take for Debajyoti to get ready. While waiting, he wonders what is the minimum possible amount of time he will spend driving provided he starts the moment Debajyoti arrives, which can be anywhere between 00 to ∞\\infty seconds from now. Can you tell Harsh the minimum possible amount of time he needs to spend on the road?Please note that Harsh can only start or stop driving at integer moments of time."

    "url": "https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-string-from-binary-tree",
    "description": "Given the root node of a binary tree, your task is to create a string representation of the tree following a specific set of formatting rules. The representation should be based on a preorder traversal of the binary tree and must adhere to the following guidelines: Node Representation: Each node in the tree should be represented by its integer value. Parentheses for Children: If a node has at least one child (either left or right), its children should be represented inside parentheses. Specifically: Omitting Empty Parentheses: Any empty parentheses pairs (i.e., ()) should be omitted from the final string representation of the tree, with one specific exception: when a node has a right child but no left child. In such cases, you must include an empty pair of parentheses to indicate the absence of the left child. This ensures that the one-to-one mapping between the string representation and the original binary tree structure is maintained. In summary, empty parentheses pairs should be omitted when a node has only a left child or no children. However, when a node has a right child but no left child, an empty pair of parentheses must precede the representation of the right child to reflect the tree's structure accurately."

For example, \"0:start:3\" means a function call with function ID 0 started at the beginning of timestamp 3, and \"1:end:2\" means a function call with function ID 1 ended at the end of timestamp 2. Note that a function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively. A function's exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for 2 time units and another call executing for 1 time unit, the exclusive time is 2 + 1 = 3.

These threads should pass the barrier in groups of three, and they must immediately bond with each other to form a water molecule. You must guarantee that all the threads from one molecule bond before any other threads from the next molecule do. In other words: We do not have to worry about matching the threads up explicitly; the threads do not necessarily know which other threads they are paired up with. The key is that threads pass the barriers in complete sets; thus, if we examine the sequence of threads that bind and divide them into groups of three, each group should contain one oxygen and two hydrogen threads.
